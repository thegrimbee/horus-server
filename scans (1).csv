 If the amount of the Dispute is less than $10,000, then JAMS’ Optional Expedited Arbitration Rules and Procedures will apply
 The dispute (including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable) will be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS International Arbitration Rules
 Except as required by applicable law or court order, you and NVIDIA agree to maintain confidentiality (and request the arbitrator to maintain confidentiality) of all aspects and outcomes of the arbitration, except a party may disclose information regarding the arbitration to (i) enforce this clause or an arbitration award or (ii) seek provisional remedies from a court of competent jurisdiction
 The arbitrator will not have authority to award damages greater than the amount, or other than the types, allowed by this Agreement
 You and NVIDIA agree the arbitration award will be final and binding without appeal or review except as permitted by governing law
If this arbitration provision is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed
 Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the arbitration provision, which shall remain in force, or the parties' ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the arbitration
 THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS NVIDIA AGREES OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S DISPUTES
 YOU AND NVIDIA AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON INDIVIDUAL DISPUTE(S)
 YOU AND NVIDIA AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND NVIDIA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND
Right to Opt-OutYou may opt-out of the foregoing jury trial, class action, arbitration, and collective or consolidated proceeding waiver provisions by notifying NVIDIA in writing within 30 days of commencement of use of the Site or within 30 days of any future change NVIDIA may make to the arbitration provisions in these Terms

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc
, 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed


Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it
 By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users
 This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it
 (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead
) You can apply it to your programs, too


When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price
 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things


To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it


For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have
 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code
 And you must show them these terms so they know their rights


We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software
 If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations


Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents
 We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary
 To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all


The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow


GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License
 The ""Program"", below, refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program"" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language
 (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term ""modification""
) Each licensee is addressed as ""you""


Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope
 The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program)
 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does


1
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee


2
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change


b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License


c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License
 (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
 If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works
 But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License


3
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code
 (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it
 For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable
 However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable


If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code


4
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License
 Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance


5
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it
 However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works
 These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
 Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it


6
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions
 You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License


7
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License
 If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all
 For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices
 Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License


8
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded
 In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License


9
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns


Each version is given a distinguishing version number
 If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation
 If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation


10
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission
 For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this
 Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally


12
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES
","


Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time


NO WARRANTY

11
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
 THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU
 SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION",,"the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software. if you distribute copies of free software, you must give recipients all the rights that you have. if you receive source code or can get it if you want it, you must change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs. if the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original.","the free software foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License. there is no warranty for the free software, to the extent PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

# The `__generator` helper

The `__generator` helper is a function designed to support TypeScript's down-level emit for
async functions when targeting ES5 and earlier
 But how, exactly, does it work?

Here's the body of the `__generator` helper:

```js
__generator = function (thisArg, body) {
    var _ = { label: 0, sent: function() { if (t[0] & 1) throw t[1]; return t[1]; }, trys: [], ops: [] }, f, y, t;
    return { next: verb(0), ""throw"": verb(1), ""return"": verb(2) };
    function verb(n) { return function (v) { return step([n, v]); }; }
    function step(op) {
        if (f) throw new TypeError(""Generator is already executing
"");
        while (_) try {
            if (f = 1, y && (t = y[op[0] & 2 ? ""return"" : op[0] ? ""throw"" : ""next""]) && !(t = t
call(y, op[1]))
done) return t;
            if (y = 0, t) op = [0, t
value];
            switch (op[0]) {
                case 0: case 1: t = op; break;
                case 4: _
label++; return { value: op[1], done: false };
                case 5: _
label++; y = op[1]; op = [0]; continue;
                case 7: op = _
ops
pop(); _
trys
pop(); continue;
                default:
                    if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) { _ = 0; continue; }
                    if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) { _
label = op[1]; break; }
                    if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) { _
label = t[1]; t = op; break; }
                    if (t && _
label < t[2]) { _
label = t[2]; _
ops
push(op); break; }
                    if (t[2]) _
ops
pop();
                    _
trys
pop(); continue;
            }
            op = body
call(thisArg, _);
        } catch (e) { op = [6, e]; y = 0; } finally { f = t = 0; }
        if (op[0] & 5) throw op[1]; return { value: op[0] ? op[1] : void 0, done: true };
    }
};
```

And here's an example of it in use:

```ts
// source
async function func(x) {
    try {
        await x;
    }
    catch (e) {
        console
error(e);
    }
    finally {
        console
log(""finally"");
    }
}

// generated
function func(x) {
    return __awaiter(this, void 0, void 0, function () {
        var e_1;
        return __generator(this, function (_a) {
            switch (_a
label) {
                case 0:
                    _a
trys
push([0, 1, 3, 4]);
                    return [4 /*yield*/, x];
                case 1:
                    _a
sent();
                    return [3 /*break*/, 4];
                case 2:
                    e_1 = _a
sent();
                    console
error(e_1);
                    return [3 /*break*/, 4];
                case 3:
                    console
log(""finally"");
                    return [7 /*endfinally*/];
                case 4: return [2 /*return*/];
            }
        });
    });
}
```

There is a lot going on in this function, so the following will break down what each part of the
`__generator` helper does and how it works


# Opcodes

The `__generator` helper uses opcodes which represent various operations that are interpreted by
the helper to affect its internal state
 The following table lists the various opcodes, their
arguments, and their purpose:

| Opcode         | Arguments | Purpose                                                                                                                        |
|----------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 (next)       | *value*   | Starts the generator, or resumes the generator with *value* as the result of the `AwaitExpression` where execution was paused
 |
| 1 (throw)      | *value*   | Resumes the generator, throwing *value* at `AwaitExpression` where execution was paused
                                       |
| 2 (return)     | *value*   | Exits the generator, executing any `finally` blocks starting at the `AwaitExpression` where execution was paused
              |
| 3 (break)      | *label*   | Performs an unconditional jump to the specified label, executing any `finally` between the current instruction and the label
  |
| 4 (yield)      | *value*   | Suspends the generator, setting the resume point at the next label and yielding the value
                                     |
| 5 (yieldstar)  | *value*   | Suspends the generator, setting the resume point at the next label and delegating operations to the supplied value
            |
| 6 (catch)      | *error*   | An internal instruction used to indicate an exception that was thrown from the body of the generator
                          |
| 7 (endfinally) |           | Exits a finally block, resuming any previous operation (such as a break, return, throw, etc
)                                  |

# State
The `_`, `f`, `y`, and `t` variables make up the persistent state of the `__generator` function
 Each variable
has a specific purpose, as described in the following sections:

## The `_` variable
The `__generator` helper must share state between its internal `step` orchestration function and
the `body` function passed to the helper


```ts
var _ = {
    label: 0,
    sent: function() {
        if (t[0] & 1) // NOTE: true for `throw`, but not `next` or `catch`
            throw t[1];
        return sent[1];
    },
    trys: [],
    ops: []
};
```

The following table describes the members of the `_` state object and their purpose:

| Name    | Description                                                                                                               |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `label` | Specifies the next switch case to execute in the `body` function
                                                         |
| `sent`  | Handles the completion result passed to the generator
                                                                    |
| `trys`  | A stack of **Protected Regions**, which are 4-tuples that describe the labels that make up a `try

catch

finally` block
 |
| `ops`   | A stack of pending operations used for `try

finally` blocks
                                                             |

The `__generator` helper passes this state object to the `body` function for use with switching
between switch cases in the body, handling completions from `AwaitExpression`, etc


## The `f` variable
The `f` variable indicates whether the generator is currently executing, to prevent re-entry of
the same generator during its execution


## The `y` variable
The `y` variable stores the iterator passed to a `yieldstar` instruction to which operations should be delegated


## The `t` variable
The `t` variable is a temporary variable that stores one of the following values:

- The completion value when resuming from a `yield` or `yield*`

- The error value for a catch block

- The current **Protected Region**

- The verb (`next`, `throw`, or `return` method) to delegate to the expression of a `yield*`

- The result of evaluating the verb delegated to the expression of a `yield*`


> NOTE: None of the above cases overlap


# Protected Regions
A **Protected Region** is a region within the `body` function that indicates a
`try

catch

finally` statement
 It consists of a 4-tuple that contains 4 labels:

| Offset | Description                                                                             |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0      | *Required* The label that indicates the beginning of a `try

catch

finally` statement
 |
| 1      | *Optional* The label that indicates the beginning of a `catch` clause
                  |
| 2      | *Optional* The label that indicates the beginning of a `finally` clause
                |
| 3      | *Required* The label that indicates the end of the `try

catch

finally` statement
     |

# The generator object
The final step of the `__generator` helper is the allocation of an object that implements the
`Generator` protocol, to be used by the `__awaiter` helper:

```ts
return { next: verb(0), ""throw"": verb(1), ""return"": verb(2) };
function verb(n) { return function (v) { return step([n, v]); }; }
```

This object translates calls to `next`, `throw`, and `return` to the appropriate Opcodes and
invokes the `step` orchestration function to continue execution
 The `throw` and `return` method
names are quoted to better support ES3


# Orchestration
The `step` function is the main orechestration mechanism for the `__generator` helper
 It
interprets opcodes, handles **protected regions**, and communicates results back to the caller


Here's a closer look at the `step` function:

```ts
function step(op) {
    if (f) throw new TypeError(""Generator is already executing
"");
    while (_) try {
        if (f = 1, y && (t = y[op[0] & 2 ? ""return"" : op[0] ? ""throw"" : ""next""]) && !(t = t
call(y, op[1]))
done) return t;
        if (y = 0, t) op = [0, t
value];
        switch (op[0]) {
            case 0: case 1: t = op; break;
            case 4: _
label++; return { value: op[1], done: false };
            case 5: _
label++; y = op[1]; op = [0]; continue;
            case 7: op = _
ops
pop(); _
trys
pop(); continue;
            default:
                if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) { _ = 0; continue; }
                if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) { _
label = op[1]; break; }
                if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) { _
label = t[1]; t = op; break; }
                if (t && _
label < t[2]) { _
label = t[2]; _
ops
push(op); break; }
                if (t[2]) _
ops
pop();
                _
trys
pop(); continue;
        }
        op = body
call(thisArg, _);
    } catch (e) { op = [6, e]; y = 0; } finally { f = t = 0; }
    if (op[0] & 5) throw op[1]; return { value: op[0] ? op[1] : void 0, done: true };
}
```

The main body of `step` exists in a `while` loop
 This allows us to continually interpret
operations until we have reached some completion value, be it a `return`, `await`, or `throw`


## Preventing re-entry
The first part of the `step` function is used as a check to prevent re-entry into a currently
executing generator:

```ts
if (f) throw new TypeError(""Generator is already executing
"");
```

## Running the generator
The main body of the `step` function consists of a `while` loop which continues to evaluate
instructions until the generator exits or is suspended:

```ts
while (_) try 



```

When the generator has run to completion, the `_` state variable will be cleared, forcing the loop
to exit


## Evaluating the generator body

```ts
try {
    



    op = body
call(thisArg, _);
}
catch (e) {
    op = [6, e];
    y = 0;
}
finally {
    f = t = 0;
}
```

Depending on the current operation, we re-enter the generator body to start or continue execution

Here we invoke `body` with `thisArg` as the `this` binding and the `_` state object as the only
argument
 The result is a tuple that contains the next Opcode and argument


If evaluation of the body resulted in an exception, we convert this into an Opcode 6 (""catch"")
operation to be handled in the next spin of the `while` loop
 We also clear the `y` variable in
case it is set to ensure we are no longer delegating operations as the exception occurred in
user code *outside* of, or at the function boundary of, the delegated iterator (otherwise the
iterator would have handled the exception itself)


After executing user code, we clear the `f` flag that indicates we are executing the generator,
as well as the `t` temporary value so that we don't hold onto values sent to the generator for
longer than necessary


Inside of the `try

finally` statement are a series of statements that are used to evaluate the
operations of the transformed generator body


The first thing we do is mark the generator as executing:

```ts
if (f = 1, 


)
```

Despite the fact this expression is part of the head of an `if` statement, the comma operator
causes it to be evaluated and the result thrown out


## Delegating `yield*`

The first two statements of the `try

finally` statement handle delegation for `yield*`:

```ts
if (f = 1, y && (t = y[op[0] & 2 ? ""return"" : op[0] ? ""throw"" : ""next""]) && !(t = t
call(y, op[1]))
done) return t;
if (y = 0, t) op = [0, t
value];
```

If the `y` variable is set, and `y` has a `next`, `throw`, or `return` method (depending on the
current operation), we invoke this method and store the return value (an IteratorResult) in `t`


If `t` indicates it is a yielded value (e
g
 `t
done === false`), we return `t` to the caller

If `t` indicates it is a returned value (e
g
 `t
done === true`), we mark the operation with the
`next` Opcode, and the returned value

If `y` did not have the appropriate method, or `t` was a returned value, we reset `y` to a falsey
value and continue processing the operation


## Handling operations

The various Opcodes are handled in the following switch statement:

```ts
switch (op[0]) {
    case 0: case 1: t = op; break;
    case 4: _
label++; return { value: op[1], done: false };
    case 5: _
label++; y = op[1]; op = [0]; continue;
    case 7: op = _
ops
pop(); _
trys
pop(); continue;
    default:
        if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) { _ = 0; continue; }
        if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) { _
label = op[1]; break; }
        if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) { _
label = t[1]; t = op; break; }
        if (t && _
label < t[2]) { _
label = t[2]; _
ops
push(op); break; }
        if (t[2]) _
ops
pop();
        _
trys
pop(); continue;
}
```

The following sections describe the various Opcodes:

### Opcode 0 (""next"") and Opcode 1 (""throw"")
```ts
case 0: // next
case 1: // throw
    t = op;
    break;
```

Both Opcode 0 (""next"") and Opcode 1 (""throw"") have the same behavior
 The current operation is
stored in the `t` variable and the `body` function is invoked
 The `body` function should call
`_
sent()` which will evaluate the appropriate completion result


### Opcode 4 (""yield"")
```ts
case 4: // yield
    _
label++;
    return { value: op[1], done: false };
```

When we encounter Opcode 4 (""yield""), we increment the label by one to indicate the point at which
the generator will resume execution
 We then return an `IteratorResult` whose `value` is the
yielded value, and `done` is `false`


### Opcode 5 (""yieldstar"")
```ts
case 5: // yieldstar
    _
label++;
    y = op[1];
    op = [0];
    continue;
```

When we receive Opcode 5 (""yieldstar""), we increment the label by one to indicate the point at which
the generator will resume execution
 We then store the iterator in `op[1]` in the `y` variable, and
set the operation to delegate to Opcode 0 (""next"") with no value
 Finally, we continue execution at
the top of the loop to start delegation


### Opcode 7 (""endfinally"")
```ts
case 7:
    op = _
ops
pop();
    _
trys
pop();
    continue;
```

Opcode 7 (""endfinally"") indicates that we have hit the end of a `finally` clause, and that the last
operation recorded before entering the `finally` block should be evaluated


### Opcode 2 (""return""), Opcode 3 (""break""), and Opcode 6 (""catch"")
```ts
default:
    if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) {
        _ = 0;
        continue;
    }
    if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) {
        _
label = op[1];
        break;
    }
    if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) {
        _
label = t[1];
        t = op;
        break;
    }
    if (t && _
label < t[2]) {
        _
label = t[2];
        _
ops
push(op);
        break;
    }
    if (t[2])
        _
ops
pop();
    _
trys
pop();
    continue;
}
```

The handling for Opcode 2 (""return""), Opcode 3 (""break"") and Opcode 6 (""catch"") is more
complicated, as we must obey the specified runtime semantics of generators
 The first line in this
clause gets the current **Protected Region** if found and stores it in the `t` temp variable:

```ts
if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && 


) 



```

The remainder of this statement, as well as the following by several `if` statements test for more
complex conditions
 The first of these is the following:

```ts
if (!(t = 


) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) {
    _ = 0;
    continue;
}
```

If we encounter an Opcode 6 (""catch"") or Opcode 2 (""return""), and we are not in a protected region,
then this operation completes the generator by setting the `_` variable to a falsey value
 The
`continue` statement resumes execution at the top of the `while` statement, which will exit the loop
so that we continue execution at the statement following the loop


```ts
if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) {
    _
label = op[1];
    break;
}
```

The `if` statement above handles Opcode 3 (""break"") when we are either not in a **protected region**, or
are performing an unconditional jump to a label inside of the current **protected region**
 In this case
we can unconditionally jump to the specified label


```ts
if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) {
    _
label = t[1];
    t = op;
    break;
}
```

The `if` statement above handles Opcode 6 (""catch"") when inside the `try` block of a **protected
region**
 In this case we jump to the `catch` block, if present
 We replace the value of `t` with
the operation so that the exception can be read as the first statement of the transformed `catch`
clause of the transformed generator body


```ts
if (t && _
label < t[2]) {
    _
label = t[2];
    _
ops
push(op);
    break;
}
```

This `if` statement handles all Opcodes when in a **protected region** with a `finally` clause

As long as we are not already inside the `finally` clause, we jump to the `finally` clause and
push the pending operation onto the `_
ops` stack
 This allows us to resume execution of the
pending operation once we have completed execution of the `finally` clause, as long as it does not
supersede this operation with its own completion value


```ts
if (t[2])
    _
ops
pop();
```

Any other completion value inside of a `finally` clause will supersede the pending completion value
from the `try` or `catch` clauses
 The above `if` statement pops the pending completion from the
stack


```ts
_
trys
pop();
continue;
```

The remaining statements handle the point at which we exit a **protected region**
 Here we pop the
current **protected region** from the stack and spin the `while` statement to evaluate the current
operation again in the next **protected region** or at the function boundary


## Handling a completed generator
Once the generator has completed, the `_` state variable will be falsey
 As a result, the `while`
loop will terminate and hand control off to the final statement of the orchestration function,
which deals with how a completed generator is evaluated:

```ts
if (op[0] & 5)
    throw op[1];
return { value: op[0] ? op[1] : void 0, done: true };
```

If the caller calls `throw` on the generator it will send Opcode 1 (""throw"")
 If an exception
is uncaught within the body of the generator, it will send Opcode 6 (""catch"")
 As the generator has
completed, it throws the exception
 Both of these cases are caught by the bitmask `5`, which does
not collide with the only two other valid completion Opcodes


If the caller calls `next` on the generator, it will send Opcode 0 (""next"")
 As the generator has
completed, it returns an `IteratorResult` where `value` is `undefined` and `done` is true


If the caller calls `return` on the generator, it will send Opcode 2 (""return"")
 As the generator
has completed, it returns an `IteratorResult` where `value` is the value provided to `return`, and
`done` is true

# The `__generator` helper

The `__generator` helper is a function designed to support TypeScript's down-level emit for
async functions when targeting ES5 and earlier
 But how, exactly, does it work?

Here's the body of the `__generator` helper:

```js
__generator = function (thisArg, body) {
    var _ = { label: 0, sent: function() { if (t[0] & 1) throw t[1]; return t[1]; }, trys: [], ops: [] }, f, y, t;
    return { next: verb(0), ""throw"": verb(1), ""return"": verb(2) };
    function verb(n) { return function (v) { return step([n, v]); }; }
    function step(op) {
        if (f) throw new TypeError(""Generator is already executing
"");
        while (_) try {
            if (f = 1, y && (t = y[op[0] & 2 ? ""return"" : op[0] ? ""throw"" : ""next""]) && !(t = t
call(y, op[1]))
done) return t;
            if (y = 0, t) op = [0, t
value];
            switch (op[0]) {
                case 0: case 1: t = op; break;
                case 4: _
label++; return { value: op[1], done: false };
                case 5: _
label++; y = op[1]; op = [0]; continue;
                case 7: op = _
ops
pop(); _
trys
pop(); continue;
                default:
                    if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) { _ = 0; continue; }
                    if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) { _
label = op[1]; break; }
                    if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) { _
label = t[1]; t = op; break; }
                    if (t && _
label < t[2]) { _
label = t[2]; _
ops
push(op); break; }
                    if (t[2]) _
ops
pop();
                    _
trys
pop(); continue;
            }
            op = body
call(thisArg, _);
        } catch (e) { op = [6, e]; y = 0; } finally { f = t = 0; }
        if (op[0] & 5) throw op[1]; return { value: op[0] ? op[1] : void 0, done: true };
    }
};
```

And here's an example of it in use:

```ts
// source
async function func(x) {
    try {
        await x;
    }
    catch (e) {
        console
error(e);
    }
    finally {
        console
log(""finally"");
    }
}

// generated
function func(x) {
    return __awaiter(this, void 0, void 0, function () {
        var e_1;
        return __generator(this, function (_a) {
            switch (_a
label) {
                case 0:
                    _a
trys
push([0, 1, 3, 4]);
                    return [4 /*yield*/, x];
                case 1:
                    _a
sent();
                    return [3 /*break*/, 4];
                case 2:
                    e_1 = _a
sent();
                    console
error(e_1);
                    return [3 /*break*/, 4];
                case 3:
                    console
log(""finally"");
                    return [7 /*endfinally*/];
                case 4: return [2 /*return*/];
            }
        });
    });
}
```

There is a lot going on in this function, so the following will break down what each part of the
`__generator` helper does and how it works


# Opcodes

The `__generator` helper uses opcodes which represent various operations that are interpreted by
the helper to affect its internal state
 The following table lists the various opcodes, their
arguments, and their purpose:

| Opcode         | Arguments | Purpose                                                                                                                        |
|----------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 (next)       | *value*   | Starts the generator, or resumes the generator with *value* as the result of the `AwaitExpression` where execution was paused
 |
| 1 (throw)      | *value*   | Resumes the generator, throwing *value* at `AwaitExpression` where execution was paused
                                       |
| 2 (return)     | *value*   | Exits the generator, executing any `finally` blocks starting at the `AwaitExpression` where execution was paused
              |
| 3 (break)      | *label*   | Performs an unconditional jump to the specified label, executing any `finally` between the current instruction and the label
  |
| 4 (yield)      | *value*   | Suspends the generator, setting the resume point at the next label and yielding the value
                                     |
| 5 (yieldstar)  | *value*   | Suspends the generator, setting the resume point at the next label and delegating operations to the supplied value
            |
| 6 (catch)      | *error*   | An internal instruction used to indicate an exception that was thrown from the body of the generator
                          |
| 7 (endfinally) |           | Exits a finally block, resuming any previous operation (such as a break, return, throw, etc
)                                  |

# State
The `_`, `f`, `y`, and `t` variables make up the persistent state of the `__generator` function
 Each variable
has a specific purpose, as described in the following sections:

## The `_` variable
The `__generator` helper must share state between its internal `step` orchestration function and
the `body` function passed to the helper


```ts
var _ = {
    label: 0,
    sent: function() {
        if (t[0] & 1) // NOTE: true for `throw`, but not `next` or `catch`
            throw t[1];
        return sent[1];
    },
    trys: [],
    ops: []
};
```

The following table describes the members of the `_` state object and their purpose:

| Name    | Description                                                                                                               |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `label` | Specifies the next switch case to execute in the `body` function
                                                         |
| `sent`  | Handles the completion result passed to the generator
                                                                    |
| `trys`  | A stack of **Protected Regions**, which are 4-tuples that describe the labels that make up a `try

catch

finally` block
 |
| `ops`   | A stack of pending operations used for `try

finally` blocks
                                                             |

The `__generator` helper passes this state object to the `body` function for use with switching
between switch cases in the body, handling completions from `AwaitExpression`, etc


## The `f` variable
The `f` variable indicates whether the generator is currently executing, to prevent re-entry of
the same generator during its execution


## The `y` variable
The `y` variable stores the iterator passed to a `yieldstar` instruction to which operations should be delegated


## The `t` variable
The `t` variable is a temporary variable that stores one of the following values:

- The completion value when resuming from a `yield` or `yield*`

- The error value for a catch block

- The current **Protected Region**

- The verb (`next`, `throw`, or `return` method) to delegate to the expression of a `yield*`

- The result of evaluating the verb delegated to the expression of a `yield*`


> NOTE: None of the above cases overlap


# Protected Regions
A **Protected Region** is a region within the `body` function that indicates a
`try

catch

finally` statement
 It consists of a 4-tuple that contains 4 labels:

| Offset | Description                                                                             |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0      | *Required* The label that indicates the beginning of a `try

catch

finally` statement
 |
| 1      | *Optional* The label that indicates the beginning of a `catch` clause
                  |
| 2      | *Optional* The label that indicates the beginning of a `finally` clause
                |
| 3      | *Required* The label that indicates the end of the `try

catch

finally` statement
     |

# The generator object
The final step of the `__generator` helper is the allocation of an object that implements the
`Generator` protocol, to be used by the `__awaiter` helper:

```ts
return { next: verb(0), ""throw"": verb(1), ""return"": verb(2) };
function verb(n) { return function (v) { return step([n, v]); }; }
```

This object translates calls to `next`, `throw`, and `return` to the appropriate Opcodes and
invokes the `step` orchestration function to continue execution
 The `throw` and `return` method
names are quoted to better support ES3


# Orchestration
The `step` function is the main orechestration mechanism for the `__generator` helper
 It
interprets opcodes, handles **protected regions**, and communicates results back to the caller


Here's a closer look at the `step` function:

```ts
function step(op) {
    if (f) throw new TypeError(""Generator is already executing
"");
    while (_) try {
        if (f = 1, y && (t = y[op[0] & 2 ? ""return"" : op[0] ? ""throw"" : ""next""]) && !(t = t
call(y, op[1]))
done) return t;
        if (y = 0, t) op = [0, t
value];
        switch (op[0]) {
            case 0: case 1: t = op; break;
            case 4: _
label++; return { value: op[1], done: false };
            case 5: _
label++; y = op[1]; op = [0]; continue;
            case 7: op = _
ops
pop(); _
trys
pop(); continue;
            default:
                if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) { _ = 0; continue; }
                if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) { _
label = op[1]; break; }
                if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) { _
label = t[1]; t = op; break; }
                if (t && _
label < t[2]) { _
label = t[2]; _
ops
push(op); break; }
                if (t[2]) _
ops
pop();
                _
trys
pop(); continue;
        }
        op = body
call(thisArg, _);
    } catch (e) { op = [6, e]; y = 0; } finally { f = t = 0; }
    if (op[0] & 5) throw op[1]; return { value: op[0] ? op[1] : void 0, done: true };
}
```

The main body of `step` exists in a `while` loop
 This allows us to continually interpret
operations until we have reached some completion value, be it a `return`, `await`, or `throw`


## Preventing re-entry
The first part of the `step` function is used as a check to prevent re-entry into a currently
executing generator:

```ts
if (f) throw new TypeError(""Generator is already executing
"");
```

## Running the generator
The main body of the `step` function consists of a `while` loop which continues to evaluate
instructions until the generator exits or is suspended:

```ts
while (_) try 



```

When the generator has run to completion, the `_` state variable will be cleared, forcing the loop
to exit


## Evaluating the generator body

```ts
try {
    



    op = body
call(thisArg, _);
}
catch (e) {
    op = [6, e];
    y = 0;
}
finally {
    f = t = 0;
}
```

Depending on the current operation, we re-enter the generator body to start or continue execution

Here we invoke `body` with `thisArg` as the `this` binding and the `_` state object as the only
argument
 The result is a tuple that contains the next Opcode and argument


If evaluation of the body resulted in an exception, we convert this into an Opcode 6 (""catch"")
operation to be handled in the next spin of the `while` loop
 We also clear the `y` variable in
case it is set to ensure we are no longer delegating operations as the exception occurred in
user code *outside* of, or at the function boundary of, the delegated iterator (otherwise the
iterator would have handled the exception itself)


After executing user code, we clear the `f` flag that indicates we are executing the generator,
as well as the `t` temporary value so that we don't hold onto values sent to the generator for
longer than necessary


Inside of the `try

finally` statement are a series of statements that are used to evaluate the
operations of the transformed generator body


The first thing we do is mark the generator as executing:

```ts
if (f = 1, 


)
```

Despite the fact this expression is part of the head of an `if` statement, the comma operator
causes it to be evaluated and the result thrown out


## Delegating `yield*`

The first two statements of the `try

finally` statement handle delegation for `yield*`:

```ts
if (f = 1, y && (t = y[op[0] & 2 ? ""return"" : op[0] ? ""throw"" : ""next""]) && !(t = t
call(y, op[1]))
done) return t;
if (y = 0, t) op = [0, t
value];
```

If the `y` variable is set, and `y` has a `next`, `throw`, or `return` method (depending on the
current operation), we invoke this method and store the return value (an IteratorResult) in `t`


If `t` indicates it is a yielded value (e
g
 `t
done === false`), we return `t` to the caller

If `t` indicates it is a returned value (e
g
 `t
done === true`), we mark the operation with the
`next` Opcode, and the returned value

If `y` did not have the appropriate method, or `t` was a returned value, we reset `y` to a falsey
value and continue processing the operation


## Handling operations

The various Opcodes are handled in the following switch statement:

```ts
switch (op[0]) {
    case 0: case 1: t = op; break;
    case 4: _
label++; return { value: op[1], done: false };
    case 5: _
label++; y = op[1]; op = [0]; continue;
    case 7: op = _
ops
pop(); _
trys
pop(); continue;
    default:
        if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) { _ = 0; continue; }
        if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) { _
label = op[1]; break; }
        if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) { _
label = t[1]; t = op; break; }
        if (t && _
label < t[2]) { _
label = t[2]; _
ops
push(op); break; }
        if (t[2]) _
ops
pop();
        _
trys
pop(); continue;
}
```

The following sections describe the various Opcodes:

### Opcode 0 (""next"") and Opcode 1 (""throw"")
```ts
case 0: // next
case 1: // throw
    t = op;
    break;
```

Both Opcode 0 (""next"") and Opcode 1 (""throw"") have the same behavior
 The current operation is
stored in the `t` variable and the `body` function is invoked
 The `body` function should call
`_
sent()` which will evaluate the appropriate completion result


### Opcode 4 (""yield"")
```ts
case 4: // yield
    _
label++;
    return { value: op[1], done: false };
```

When we encounter Opcode 4 (""yield""), we increment the label by one to indicate the point at which
the generator will resume execution
 We then return an `IteratorResult` whose `value` is the
yielded value, and `done` is `false`


### Opcode 5 (""yieldstar"")
```ts
case 5: // yieldstar
    _
label++;
    y = op[1];
    op = [0];
    continue;
```

When we receive Opcode 5 (""yieldstar""), we increment the label by one to indicate the point at which
the generator will resume execution
 We then store the iterator in `op[1]` in the `y` variable, and
set the operation to delegate to Opcode 0 (""next"") with no value
 Finally, we continue execution at
the top of the loop to start delegation


### Opcode 7 (""endfinally"")
```ts
case 7:
    op = _
ops
pop();
    _
trys
pop();
    continue;
```

Opcode 7 (""endfinally"") indicates that we have hit the end of a `finally` clause, and that the last
operation recorded before entering the `finally` block should be evaluated


### Opcode 2 (""return""), Opcode 3 (""break""), and Opcode 6 (""catch"")
```ts
default:
    if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) {
        _ = 0;
        continue;
    }
    if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) {
        _
label = op[1];
        break;
    }
    if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) {
        _
label = t[1];
        t = op;
        break;
    }
    if (t && _
label < t[2]) {
        _
label = t[2];
        _
ops
push(op);
        break;
    }
    if (t[2])
        _
ops
pop();
    _
trys
pop();
    continue;
}
```

The handling for Opcode 2 (""return""), Opcode 3 (""break"") and Opcode 6 (""catch"") is more
complicated, as we must obey the specified runtime semantics of generators
 The first line in this
clause gets the current **Protected Region** if found and stores it in the `t` temp variable:

```ts
if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && 


) 



```

The remainder of this statement, as well as the following by several `if` statements test for more
complex conditions
 The first of these is the following:

```ts
if (!(t = 


) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) {
    _ = 0;
    continue;
}
```

If we encounter an Opcode 6 (""catch"") or Opcode 2 (""return""), and we are not in a protected region,
then this operation completes the generator by setting the `_` variable to a falsey value
 The
`continue` statement resumes execution at the top of the `while` statement, which will exit the loop
so that we continue execution at the statement following the loop


```ts
if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) {
    _
label = op[1];
    break;
}
```

The `if` statement above handles Opcode 3 (""break"") when we are either not in a **protected region**, or
are performing an unconditional jump to a label inside of the current **protected region**
 In this case
we can unconditionally jump to the specified label


```ts
if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) {
    _
label = t[1];
    t = op;
    break;
}
```

The `if` statement above handles Opcode 6 (""catch"") when inside the `try` block of a **protected
region**
 In this case we jump to the `catch` block, if present
 We replace the value of `t` with
the operation so that the exception can be read as the first statement of the transformed `catch`
clause of the transformed generator body


```ts
if (t && _
label < t[2]) {
    _
label = t[2];
    _
ops
push(op);
    break;
}
```

This `if` statement handles all Opcodes when in a **protected region** with a `finally` clause

As long as we are not already inside the `finally` clause, we jump to the `finally` clause and
push the pending operation onto the `_
ops` stack
 This allows us to resume execution of the
pending operation once we have completed execution of the `finally` clause, as long as it does not
supersede this operation with its own completion value


```ts
if (t[2])
    _
ops
pop();
```

Any other completion value inside of a `finally` clause will supersede the pending completion value
from the `try` or `catch` clauses
 The above `if` statement pops the pending completion from the
stack


```ts
_
trys
pop();
continue;
```

The remaining statements handle the point at which we exit a **protected region**
 Here we pop the
current **protected region** from the stack and spin the `while` statement to evaluate the current
operation again in the next **protected region** or at the function boundary


## Handling a completed generator
Once the generator has completed, the `_` state variable will be falsey
 As a result, the `while`
loop will terminate and hand control off to the final statement of the orchestration function,
which deals with how a completed generator is evaluated:

```ts
if (op[0] & 5)
    throw op[1];
return { value: op[0] ? op[1] : void 0, done: true };
```

If the caller calls `throw` on the generator it will send Opcode 1 (""throw"")
 If an exception
is uncaught within the body of the generator, it will send Opcode 6 (""catch"")
 As the generator has
completed, it throws the exception
 Both of these cases are caught by the bitmask `5`, which does
not collide with the only two other valid completion Opcodes


If the caller calls `next` on the generator, it will send Opcode 0 (""next"")
 As the generator has
completed, it returns an `IteratorResult` where `value` is `undefined` and `done` is true


If the caller calls `return` on the generator, it will send Opcode 2 (""return"")
 As the generator
has completed, it returns an `IteratorResult` where `value` is the value provided to `return`, and
`done` is true

# The `__generator` helper

The `__generator` helper is a function designed to support TypeScript's down-level emit for
async functions when targeting ES5 and earlier
 But how, exactly, does it work?

Here's the body of the `__generator` helper:

```js
__generator = function (thisArg, body) {
    var _ = { label: 0, sent: function() { if (t[0] & 1) throw t[1]; return t[1]; }, trys: [], ops: [] }, f, y, t;
    return { next: verb(0), ""throw"": verb(1), ""return"": verb(2) };
    function verb(n) { return function (v) { return step([n, v]); }; }
    function step(op) {
        if (f) throw new TypeError(""Generator is already executing
"");
        while (_) try {
            if (f = 1, y && (t = y[op[0] & 2 ? ""return"" : op[0] ? ""throw"" : ""next""]) && !(t = t
call(y, op[1]))
done) return t;
            if (y = 0, t) op = [0, t
value];
            switch (op[0]) {
                case 0: case 1: t = op; break;
                case 4: _
label++; return { value: op[1], done: false };
                case 5: _
label++; y = op[1]; op = [0]; continue;
                case 7: op = _
ops
pop(); _
trys
pop(); continue;
                default:
                    if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) { _ = 0; continue; }
                    if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) { _
label = op[1]; break; }
                    if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) { _
label = t[1]; t = op; break; }
                    if (t && _
label < t[2]) { _
label = t[2]; _
ops
push(op); break; }
                    if (t[2]) _
ops
pop();
                    _
trys
pop(); continue;
            }
            op = body
call(thisArg, _);
        } catch (e) { op = [6, e]; y = 0; } finally { f = t = 0; }
        if (op[0] & 5) throw op[1]; return { value: op[0] ? op[1] : void 0, done: true };
    }
};
```

And here's an example of it in use:

```ts
// source
async function func(x) {
    try {
        await x;
    }
    catch (e) {
        console
error(e);
    }
    finally {
        console
log(""finally"");
    }
}

// generated
function func(x) {
    return __awaiter(this, void 0, void 0, function () {
        var e_1;
        return __generator(this, function (_a) {
            switch (_a
label) {
                case 0:
                    _a
trys
push([0, 1, 3, 4]);
                    return [4 /*yield*/, x];
                case 1:
                    _a
sent();
                    return [3 /*break*/, 4];
                case 2:
                    e_1 = _a
sent();
                    console
error(e_1);
                    return [3 /*break*/, 4];
                case 3:
                    console
log(""finally"");
                    return [7 /*endfinally*/];
                case 4: return [2 /*return*/];
            }
        });
    });
}
```

There is a lot going on in this function, so the following will break down what each part of the
`__generator` helper does and how it works


# Opcodes

The `__generator` helper uses opcodes which represent various operations that are interpreted by
the helper to affect its internal state
 The following table lists the various opcodes, their
arguments, and their purpose:

| Opcode         | Arguments | Purpose                                                                                                                        |
|----------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 (next)       | *value*   | Starts the generator, or resumes the generator with *value* as the result of the `AwaitExpression` where execution was paused
 |
| 1 (throw)      | *value*   | Resumes the generator, throwing *value* at `AwaitExpression` where execution was paused
                                       |
| 2 (return)     | *value*   | Exits the generator, executing any `finally` blocks starting at the `AwaitExpression` where execution was paused
              |
| 3 (break)      | *label*   | Performs an unconditional jump to the specified label, executing any `finally` between the current instruction and the label
  |
| 4 (yield)      | *value*   | Suspends the generator, setting the resume point at the next label and yielding the value
                                     |
| 5 (yieldstar)  | *value*   | Suspends the generator, setting the resume point at the next label and delegating operations to the supplied value
            |
| 6 (catch)      | *error*   | An internal instruction used to indicate an exception that was thrown from the body of the generator
                          |
| 7 (endfinally) |           | Exits a finally block, resuming any previous operation (such as a break, return, throw, etc
)                                  |

# State
The `_`, `f`, `y`, and `t` variables make up the persistent state of the `__generator` function
 Each variable
has a specific purpose, as described in the following sections:

## The `_` variable
The `__generator` helper must share state between its internal `step` orchestration function and
the `body` function passed to the helper


```ts
var _ = {
    label: 0,
    sent: function() {
        if (t[0] & 1) // NOTE: true for `throw`, but not `next` or `catch`
            throw t[1];
        return sent[1];
    },
    trys: [],
    ops: []
};
```

The following table describes the members of the `_` state object and their purpose:

| Name    | Description                                                                                                               |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `label` | Specifies the next switch case to execute in the `body` function
                                                         |
| `sent`  | Handles the completion result passed to the generator
                                                                    |
| `trys`  | A stack of **Protected Regions**, which are 4-tuples that describe the labels that make up a `try

catch

finally` block
 |
| `ops`   | A stack of pending operations used for `try

finally` blocks
                                                             |

The `__generator` helper passes this state object to the `body` function for use with switching
between switch cases in the body, handling completions from `AwaitExpression`, etc


## The `f` variable
The `f` variable indicates whether the generator is currently executing, to prevent re-entry of
the same generator during its execution


## The `y` variable
The `y` variable stores the iterator passed to a `yieldstar` instruction to which operations should be delegated


## The `t` variable
The `t` variable is a temporary variable that stores one of the following values:

- The completion value when resuming from a `yield` or `yield*`

- The error value for a catch block

- The current **Protected Region**

- The verb (`next`, `throw`, or `return` method) to delegate to the expression of a `yield*`

- The result of evaluating the verb delegated to the expression of a `yield*`


> NOTE: None of the above cases overlap


# Protected Regions
A **Protected Region** is a region within the `body` function that indicates a
`try

catch

finally` statement
 It consists of a 4-tuple that contains 4 labels:

| Offset | Description                                                                             |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0      | *Required* The label that indicates the beginning of a `try

catch

finally` statement
 |
| 1      | *Optional* The label that indicates the beginning of a `catch` clause
                  |
| 2      | *Optional* The label that indicates the beginning of a `finally` clause
                |
| 3      | *Required* The label that indicates the end of the `try

catch

finally` statement
     |

# The generator object
The final step of the `__generator` helper is the allocation of an object that implements the
`Generator` protocol, to be used by the `__awaiter` helper:

```ts
return { next: verb(0), ""throw"": verb(1), ""return"": verb(2) };
function verb(n) { return function (v) { return step([n, v]); }; }
```

This object translates calls to `next`, `throw`, and `return` to the appropriate Opcodes and
invokes the `step` orchestration function to continue execution
 The `throw` and `return` method
names are quoted to better support ES3


# Orchestration
The `step` function is the main orechestration mechanism for the `__generator` helper
 It
interprets opcodes, handles **protected regions**, and communicates results back to the caller


Here's a closer look at the `step` function:

```ts
function step(op) {
    if (f) throw new TypeError(""Generator is already executing
"");
    while (_) try {
        if (f = 1, y && (t = y[op[0] & 2 ? ""return"" : op[0] ? ""throw"" : ""next""]) && !(t = t
call(y, op[1]))
done) return t;
        if (y = 0, t) op = [0, t
value];
        switch (op[0]) {
            case 0: case 1: t = op; break;
            case 4: _
label++; return { value: op[1], done: false };
            case 5: _
label++; y = op[1]; op = [0]; continue;
            case 7: op = _
ops
pop(); _
trys
pop(); continue;
            default:
                if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) { _ = 0; continue; }
                if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) { _
label = op[1]; break; }
                if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) { _
label = t[1]; t = op; break; }
                if (t && _
label < t[2]) { _
label = t[2]; _
ops
push(op); break; }
                if (t[2]) _
ops
pop();
                _
trys
pop(); continue;
        }
        op = body
call(thisArg, _);
    } catch (e) { op = [6, e]; y = 0; } finally { f = t = 0; }
    if (op[0] & 5) throw op[1]; return { value: op[0] ? op[1] : void 0, done: true };
}
```

The main body of `step` exists in a `while` loop
 This allows us to continually interpret
operations until we have reached some completion value, be it a `return`, `await`, or `throw`


## Preventing re-entry
The first part of the `step` function is used as a check to prevent re-entry into a currently
executing generator:

```ts
if (f) throw new TypeError(""Generator is already executing
"");
```

## Running the generator
The main body of the `step` function consists of a `while` loop which continues to evaluate
instructions until the generator exits or is suspended:

```ts
while (_) try 



```

When the generator has run to completion, the `_` state variable will be cleared, forcing the loop
to exit


## Evaluating the generator body

```ts
try {
    



    op = body
call(thisArg, _);
}
catch (e) {
    op = [6, e];
    y = 0;
}
finally {
    f = t = 0;
}
```

Depending on the current operation, we re-enter the generator body to start or continue execution

Here we invoke `body` with `thisArg` as the `this` binding and the `_` state object as the only
argument
 The result is a tuple that contains the next Opcode and argument


If evaluation of the body resulted in an exception, we convert this into an Opcode 6 (""catch"")
operation to be handled in the next spin of the `while` loop
 We also clear the `y` variable in
case it is set to ensure we are no longer delegating operations as the exception occurred in
user code *outside* of, or at the function boundary of, the delegated iterator (otherwise the
iterator would have handled the exception itself)


After executing user code, we clear the `f` flag that indicates we are executing the generator,
as well as the `t` temporary value so that we don't hold onto values sent to the generator for
longer than necessary


Inside of the `try

finally` statement are a series of statements that are used to evaluate the
operations of the transformed generator body


The first thing we do is mark the generator as executing:

```ts
if (f = 1, 


)
```

Despite the fact this expression is part of the head of an `if` statement, the comma operator
causes it to be evaluated and the result thrown out


## Delegating `yield*`

The first two statements of the `try

finally` statement handle delegation for `yield*`:

```ts
if (f = 1, y && (t = y[op[0] & 2 ? ""return"" : op[0] ? ""throw"" : ""next""]) && !(t = t
call(y, op[1]))
done) return t;
if (y = 0, t) op = [0, t
value];
```

If the `y` variable is set, and `y` has a `next`, `throw`, or `return` method (depending on the
current operation), we invoke this method and store the return value (an IteratorResult) in `t`


If `t` indicates it is a yielded value (e
g
 `t
done === false`), we return `t` to the caller

If `t` indicates it is a returned value (e
g
 `t
done === true`), we mark the operation with the
`next` Opcode, and the returned value

If `y` did not have the appropriate method, or `t` was a returned value, we reset `y` to a falsey
value and continue processing the operation


## Handling operations

The various Opcodes are handled in the following switch statement:

```ts
switch (op[0]) {
    case 0: case 1: t = op; break;
    case 4: _
label++; return { value: op[1], done: false };
    case 5: _
label++; y = op[1]; op = [0]; continue;
    case 7: op = _
ops
pop(); _
trys
pop(); continue;
    default:
        if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) { _ = 0; continue; }
        if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) { _
label = op[1]; break; }
        if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) { _
label = t[1]; t = op; break; }
        if (t && _
label < t[2]) { _
label = t[2]; _
ops
push(op); break; }
        if (t[2]) _
ops
pop();
        _
trys
pop(); continue;
}
```

The following sections describe the various Opcodes:

### Opcode 0 (""next"") and Opcode 1 (""throw"")
```ts
case 0: // next
case 1: // throw
    t = op;
    break;
```

Both Opcode 0 (""next"") and Opcode 1 (""throw"") have the same behavior
 The current operation is
stored in the `t` variable and the `body` function is invoked
 The `body` function should call
`_
sent()` which will evaluate the appropriate completion result


### Opcode 4 (""yield"")
```ts
case 4: // yield
    _
label++;
    return { value: op[1], done: false };
```

When we encounter Opcode 4 (""yield""), we increment the label by one to indicate the point at which
the generator will resume execution
 We then return an `IteratorResult` whose `value` is the
yielded value, and `done` is `false`


### Opcode 5 (""yieldstar"")
```ts
case 5: // yieldstar
    _
label++;
    y = op[1];
    op = [0];
    continue;
```

When we receive Opcode 5 (""yieldstar""), we increment the label by one to indicate the point at which
the generator will resume execution
 We then store the iterator in `op[1]` in the `y` variable, and
set the operation to delegate to Opcode 0 (""next"") with no value
 Finally, we continue execution at
the top of the loop to start delegation


### Opcode 7 (""endfinally"")
```ts
case 7:
    op = _
ops
pop();
    _
trys
pop();
    continue;
```

Opcode 7 (""endfinally"") indicates that we have hit the end of a `finally` clause, and that the last
operation recorded before entering the `finally` block should be evaluated


### Opcode 2 (""return""), Opcode 3 (""break""), and Opcode 6 (""catch"")
```ts
default:
    if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) {
        _ = 0;
        continue;
    }
    if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) {
        _
label = op[1];
        break;
    }
    if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) {
        _
label = t[1];
        t = op;
        break;
    }
    if (t && _
label < t[2]) {
        _
label = t[2];
        _
ops
push(op);
        break;
    }
    if (t[2])
        _
ops
pop();
    _
trys
pop();
    continue;
}
```

The handling for Opcode 2 (""return""), Opcode 3 (""break"") and Opcode 6 (""catch"") is more
complicated, as we must obey the specified runtime semantics of generators
 The first line in this
clause gets the current **Protected Region** if found and stores it in the `t` temp variable:

```ts
if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && 


) 



```

The remainder of this statement, as well as the following by several `if` statements test for more
complex conditions
 The first of these is the following:

```ts
if (!(t = 


) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) {
    _ = 0;
    continue;
}
```

If we encounter an Opcode 6 (""catch"") or Opcode 2 (""return""), and we are not in a protected region,
then this operation completes the generator by setting the `_` variable to a falsey value
 The
`continue` statement resumes execution at the top of the `while` statement, which will exit the loop
so that we continue execution at the statement following the loop


```ts
if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) {
    _
label = op[1];
    break;
}
```

The `if` statement above handles Opcode 3 (""break"") when we are either not in a **protected region**, or
are performing an unconditional jump to a label inside of the current **protected region**
 In this case
we can unconditionally jump to the specified label


```ts
if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) {
    _
label = t[1];
    t = op;
    break;
}
```

The `if` statement above handles Opcode 6 (""catch"") when inside the `try` block of a **protected
region**
 In this case we jump to the `catch` block, if present
 We replace the value of `t` with
the operation so that the exception can be read as the first statement of the transformed `catch`
clause of the transformed generator body


```ts
if (t && _
label < t[2]) {
    _
label = t[2];
    _
ops
push(op);
    break;
}
```

This `if` statement handles all Opcodes when in a **protected region** with a `finally` clause

As long as we are not already inside the `finally` clause, we jump to the `finally` clause and
push the pending operation onto the `_
ops` stack
 This allows us to resume execution of the
pending operation once we have completed execution of the `finally` clause, as long as it does not
supersede this operation with its own completion value


```ts
if (t[2])
    _
ops
pop();
```

Any other completion value inside of a `finally` clause will supersede the pending completion value
from the `try` or `catch` clauses
 The above `if` statement pops the pending completion from the
stack


```ts
_
trys
pop();
continue;
```

The remaining statements handle the point at which we exit a **protected region**
 Here we pop the
current **protected region** from the stack and spin the `while` statement to evaluate the current
operation again in the next **protected region** or at the function boundary


## Handling a completed generator
Once the generator has completed, the `_` state variable will be falsey
 As a result, the `while`
loop will terminate and hand control off to the final statement of the orchestration function,
which deals with how a completed generator is evaluated:

```ts
if (op[0] & 5)
    throw op[1];
return { value: op[0] ? op[1] : void 0, done: true };
```

If the caller calls `throw` on the generator it will send Opcode 1 (""throw"")
 If an exception
is uncaught within the body of the generator, it will send Opcode 6 (""catch"")
 As the generator has
completed, it throws the exception
 Both of these cases are caught by the bitmask `5`, which does
not collide with the only two other valid completion Opcodes


If the caller calls `next` on the generator, it will send Opcode 0 (""next"")
 As the generator has
completed, it returns an `IteratorResult` where `value` is `undefined` and `done` is true


If the caller calls `return` on the generator, it will send Opcode 2 (""return"")
 As the generator
has completed, it returns an `IteratorResult` where `value` is the value provided to `return`, and
`done` is true

# The `__generator` helper

The `__generator` helper is a function designed to support TypeScript's down-level emit for
async functions when targeting ES5 and earlier
 But how, exactly, does it work?

Here's the body of the `__generator` helper:

```js
__generator = function (thisArg, body) {
    var _ = { label: 0, sent: function() { if (t[0] & 1) throw t[1]; return t[1]; }, trys: [], ops: [] }, f, y, t;
    return { next: verb(0), ""throw"": verb(1), ""return"": verb(2) };
    function verb(n) { return function (v) { return step([n, v]); }; }
    function step(op) {
        if (f) throw new TypeError(""Generator is already executing
"");
        while (_) try {
            if (f = 1, y && (t = y[op[0] & 2 ? ""return"" : op[0] ? ""throw"" : ""next""]) && !(t = t
call(y, op[1]))
done) return t;
            if (y = 0, t) op = [0, t
value];
            switch (op[0]) {
                case 0: case 1: t = op; break;
                case 4: _
label++; return { value: op[1], done: false };
                case 5: _
label++; y = op[1]; op = [0]; continue;
                case 7: op = _
ops
pop(); _
trys
pop(); continue;
                default:
                    if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) { _ = 0; continue; }
                    if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) { _
label = op[1]; break; }
                    if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) { _
label = t[1]; t = op; break; }
                    if (t && _
label < t[2]) { _
label = t[2]; _
ops
push(op); break; }
                    if (t[2]) _
ops
pop();
                    _
trys
pop(); continue;
            }
            op = body
call(thisArg, _);
        } catch (e) { op = [6, e]; y = 0; } finally { f = t = 0; }
        if (op[0] & 5) throw op[1]; return { value: op[0] ? op[1] : void 0, done: true };
    }
};
```

And here's an example of it in use:

```ts
// source
async function func(x) {
    try {
        await x;
    }
    catch (e) {
        console
error(e);
    }
    finally {
        console
log(""finally"");
    }
}

// generated
function func(x) {
    return __awaiter(this, void 0, void 0, function () {
        var e_1;
        return __generator(this, function (_a) {
            switch (_a
label) {
                case 0:
                    _a
trys
push([0, 1, 3, 4]);
                    return [4 /*yield*/, x];
                case 1:
                    _a
sent();
                    return [3 /*break*/, 4];
                case 2:
                    e_1 = _a
sent();
                    console
error(e_1);
                    return [3 /*break*/, 4];
                case 3:
                    console
log(""finally"");
                    return [7 /*endfinally*/];
                case 4: return [2 /*return*/];
            }
        });
    });
}
```

There is a lot going on in this function, so the following will break down what each part of the
`__generator` helper does and how it works


# Opcodes

The `__generator` helper uses opcodes which represent various operations that are interpreted by
the helper to affect its internal state
 The following table lists the various opcodes, their
arguments, and their purpose:

| Opcode         | Arguments | Purpose                                                                                                                        |
|----------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 (next)       | *value*   | Starts the generator, or resumes the generator with *value* as the result of the `AwaitExpression` where execution was paused
 |
| 1 (throw)      | *value*   | Resumes the generator, throwing *value* at `AwaitExpression` where execution was paused
                                       |
| 2 (return)     | *value*   | Exits the generator, executing any `finally` blocks starting at the `AwaitExpression` where execution was paused
              |
| 3 (break)      | *label*   | Performs an unconditional jump to the specified label, executing any `finally` between the current instruction and the label
  |
| 4 (yield)      | *value*   | Suspends the generator, setting the resume point at the next label and yielding the value
                                     |
| 5 (yieldstar)  | *value*   | Suspends the generator, setting the resume point at the next label and delegating operations to the supplied value
            |
| 6 (catch)      | *error*   | An internal instruction used to indicate an exception that was thrown from the body of the generator
                          |
| 7 (endfinally) |           | Exits a finally block, resuming any previous operation (such as a break, return, throw, etc
)                                  |

# State
The `_`, `f`, `y`, and `t` variables make up the persistent state of the `__generator` function
 Each variable
has a specific purpose, as described in the following sections:

## The `_` variable
The `__generator` helper must share state between its internal `step` orchestration function and
the `body` function passed to the helper


```ts
var _ = {
    label: 0,
    sent: function() {
        if (t[0] & 1) // NOTE: true for `throw`, but not `next` or `catch`
            throw t[1];
        return sent[1];
    },
    trys: [],
    ops: []
};
```

The following table describes the members of the `_` state object and their purpose:

| Name    | Description                                                                                                               |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `label` | Specifies the next switch case to execute in the `body` function
                                                         |
| `sent`  | Handles the completion result passed to the generator
                                                                    |
| `trys`  | A stack of **Protected Regions**, which are 4-tuples that describe the labels that make up a `try

catch

finally` block
 |
| `ops`   | A stack of pending operations used for `try

finally` blocks
                                                             |

The `__generator` helper passes this state object to the `body` function for use with switching
between switch cases in the body, handling completions from `AwaitExpression`, etc


## The `f` variable
The `f` variable indicates whether the generator is currently executing, to prevent re-entry of
the same generator during its execution


## The `y` variable
The `y` variable stores the iterator passed to a `yieldstar` instruction to which operations should be delegated


## The `t` variable
The `t` variable is a temporary variable that stores one of the following values:

- The completion value when resuming from a `yield` or `yield*`

- The error value for a catch block

- The current **Protected Region**

- The verb (`next`, `throw`, or `return` method) to delegate to the expression of a `yield*`

- The result of evaluating the verb delegated to the expression of a `yield*`


> NOTE: None of the above cases overlap


# Protected Regions
A **Protected Region** is a region within the `body` function that indicates a
`try

catch

finally` statement
 It consists of a 4-tuple that contains 4 labels:

| Offset | Description                                                                             |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0      | *Required* The label that indicates the beginning of a `try

catch

finally` statement
 |
| 1      | *Optional* The label that indicates the beginning of a `catch` clause
                  |
| 2      | *Optional* The label that indicates the beginning of a `finally` clause
                |
| 3      | *Required* The label that indicates the end of the `try

catch

finally` statement
     |

# The generator object
The final step of the `__generator` helper is the allocation of an object that implements the
`Generator` protocol, to be used by the `__awaiter` helper:

```ts
return { next: verb(0), ""throw"": verb(1), ""return"": verb(2) };
function verb(n) { return function (v) { return step([n, v]); }; }
```

This object translates calls to `next`, `throw`, and `return` to the appropriate Opcodes and
invokes the `step` orchestration function to continue execution
 The `throw` and `return` method
names are quoted to better support ES3


# Orchestration
The `step` function is the main orechestration mechanism for the `__generator` helper
 It
interprets opcodes, handles **protected regions**, and communicates results back to the caller


Here's a closer look at the `step` function:

```ts
function step(op) {
    if (f) throw new TypeError(""Generator is already executing
"");
    while (_) try {
        if (f = 1, y && (t = y[op[0] & 2 ? ""return"" : op[0] ? ""throw"" : ""next""]) && !(t = t
call(y, op[1]))
done) return t;
        if (y = 0, t) op = [0, t
value];
        switch (op[0]) {
            case 0: case 1: t = op; break;
            case 4: _
label++; return { value: op[1], done: false };
            case 5: _
label++; y = op[1]; op = [0]; continue;
            case 7: op = _
ops
pop(); _
trys
pop(); continue;
            default:
                if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) { _ = 0; continue; }
                if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) { _
label = op[1]; break; }
                if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) { _
label = t[1]; t = op; break; }
                if (t && _
label < t[2]) { _
label = t[2]; _
ops
push(op); break; }
                if (t[2]) _
ops
pop();
                _
trys
pop(); continue;
        }
        op = body
call(thisArg, _);
    } catch (e) { op = [6, e]; y = 0; } finally { f = t = 0; }
    if (op[0] & 5) throw op[1]; return { value: op[0] ? op[1] : void 0, done: true };
}
```

The main body of `step` exists in a `while` loop
 This allows us to continually interpret
operations until we have reached some completion value, be it a `return`, `await`, or `throw`


## Preventing re-entry
The first part of the `step` function is used as a check to prevent re-entry into a currently
executing generator:

```ts
if (f) throw new TypeError(""Generator is already executing
"");
```

## Running the generator
The main body of the `step` function consists of a `while` loop which continues to evaluate
instructions until the generator exits or is suspended:

```ts
while (_) try 



```

When the generator has run to completion, the `_` state variable will be cleared, forcing the loop
to exit


## Evaluating the generator body

```ts
try {
    



    op = body
call(thisArg, _);
}
catch (e) {
    op = [6, e];
    y = 0;
}
finally {
    f = t = 0;
}
```

Depending on the current operation, we re-enter the generator body to start or continue execution

Here we invoke `body` with `thisArg` as the `this` binding and the `_` state object as the only
argument
 The result is a tuple that contains the next Opcode and argument


If evaluation of the body resulted in an exception, we convert this into an Opcode 6 (""catch"")
operation to be handled in the next spin of the `while` loop
 We also clear the `y` variable in
case it is set to ensure we are no longer delegating operations as the exception occurred in
user code *outside* of, or at the function boundary of, the delegated iterator (otherwise the
iterator would have handled the exception itself)


After executing user code, we clear the `f` flag that indicates we are executing the generator,
as well as the `t` temporary value so that we don't hold onto values sent to the generator for
longer than necessary


Inside of the `try

finally` statement are a series of statements that are used to evaluate the
operations of the transformed generator body


The first thing we do is mark the generator as executing:

```ts
if (f = 1, 


)
```

Despite the fact this expression is part of the head of an `if` statement, the comma operator
causes it to be evaluated and the result thrown out


## Delegating `yield*`

The first two statements of the `try

finally` statement handle delegation for `yield*`:

```ts
if (f = 1, y && (t = y[op[0] & 2 ? ""return"" : op[0] ? ""throw"" : ""next""]) && !(t = t
call(y, op[1]))
done) return t;
if (y = 0, t) op = [0, t
value];
```

If the `y` variable is set, and `y` has a `next`, `throw`, or `return` method (depending on the
current operation), we invoke this method and store the return value (an IteratorResult) in `t`


If `t` indicates it is a yielded value (e
g
 `t
done === false`), we return `t` to the caller

If `t` indicates it is a returned value (e
g
 `t
done === true`), we mark the operation with the
`next` Opcode, and the returned value

If `y` did not have the appropriate method, or `t` was a returned value, we reset `y` to a falsey
value and continue processing the operation


## Handling operations

The various Opcodes are handled in the following switch statement:

```ts
switch (op[0]) {
    case 0: case 1: t = op; break;
    case 4: _
label++; return { value: op[1], done: false };
    case 5: _
label++; y = op[1]; op = [0]; continue;
    case 7: op = _
ops
pop(); _
trys
pop(); continue;
    default:
        if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) { _ = 0; continue; }
        if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) { _
label = op[1]; break; }
        if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) { _
label = t[1]; t = op; break; }
        if (t && _
label < t[2]) { _
label = t[2]; _
ops
push(op); break; }
        if (t[2]) _
ops
pop();
        _
trys
pop(); continue;
}
```

The following sections describe the various Opcodes:

### Opcode 0 (""next"") and Opcode 1 (""throw"")
```ts
case 0: // next
case 1: // throw
    t = op;
    break;
```

Both Opcode 0 (""next"") and Opcode 1 (""throw"") have the same behavior
 The current operation is
stored in the `t` variable and the `body` function is invoked
 The `body` function should call
`_
sent()` which will evaluate the appropriate completion result


### Opcode 4 (""yield"")
```ts
case 4: // yield
    _
label++;
    return { value: op[1], done: false };
```

When we encounter Opcode 4 (""yield""), we increment the label by one to indicate the point at which
the generator will resume execution
 We then return an `IteratorResult` whose `value` is the
yielded value, and `done` is `false`


### Opcode 5 (""yieldstar"")
```ts
case 5: // yieldstar
    _
label++;
    y = op[1];
    op = [0];
    continue;
```

When we receive Opcode 5 (""yieldstar""), we increment the label by one to indicate the point at which
the generator will resume execution
 We then store the iterator in `op[1]` in the `y` variable, and
set the operation to delegate to Opcode 0 (""next"") with no value
 Finally, we continue execution at
the top of the loop to start delegation


### Opcode 7 (""endfinally"")
```ts
case 7:
    op = _
ops
pop();
    _
trys
pop();
    continue;
```

Opcode 7 (""endfinally"") indicates that we have hit the end of a `finally` clause, and that the last
operation recorded before entering the `finally` block should be evaluated


### Opcode 2 (""return""), Opcode 3 (""break""), and Opcode 6 (""catch"")
```ts
default:
    if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) {
        _ = 0;
        continue;
    }
    if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) {
        _
label = op[1];
        break;
    }
    if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) {
        _
label = t[1];
        t = op;
        break;
    }
    if (t && _
label < t[2]) {
        _
label = t[2];
        _
ops
push(op);
        break;
    }
    if (t[2])
        _
ops
pop();
    _
trys
pop();
    continue;
}
```

The handling for Opcode 2 (""return""), Opcode 3 (""break"") and Opcode 6 (""catch"") is more
complicated, as we must obey the specified runtime semantics of generators
 The first line in this
clause gets the current **Protected Region** if found and stores it in the `t` temp variable:

```ts
if (!(t = _
trys, t = t
length > 0 && t[t
length - 1]) && 


) 



```

The remainder of this statement, as well as the following by several `if` statements test for more
complex conditions
 The first of these is the following:

```ts
if (!(t = 


) && (op[0] === 6 || op[0] === 2)) {
    _ = 0;
    continue;
}
```

If we encounter an Opcode 6 (""catch"") or Opcode 2 (""return""), and we are not in a protected region,
then this operation completes the generator by setting the `_` variable to a falsey value
 The
`continue` statement resumes execution at the top of the `while` statement, which will exit the loop
so that we continue execution at the statement following the loop


```ts
if (op[0] === 3 && (!t || (op[1] > t[0] && op[1] < t[3]))) {
    _
label = op[1];
    break;
}
```

The `if` statement above handles Opcode 3 (""break"") when we are either not in a **protected region**, or
are performing an unconditional jump to a label inside of the current **protected region**
 In this case
we can unconditionally jump to the specified label


```ts
if (op[0] === 6 && _
label < t[1]) {
    _
label = t[1];
    t = op;
    break;
}
```

The `if` statement above handles Opcode 6 (""catch"") when inside the `try` block of a **protected
region**
 In this case we jump to the `catch` block, if present
 We replace the value of `t` with
the operation so that the exception can be read as the first statement of the transformed `catch`
clause of the transformed generator body


```ts
if (t && _
label < t[2]) {
    _
label = t[2];
    _
ops
push(op);
    break;
}
```

This `if` statement handles all Opcodes when in a **protected region** with a `finally` clause

As long as we are not already inside the `finally` clause, we jump to the `finally` clause and
push the pending operation onto the `_
ops` stack
 This allows us to resume execution of the
pending operation once we have completed execution of the `finally` clause, as long as it does not
supersede this operation with its own completion value


```ts
if (t[2])
    _
ops
pop();
```

Any other completion value inside of a `finally` clause will supersede the pending completion value
from the `try` or `catch` clauses
 The above `if` statement pops the pending completion from the
stack


```ts
_
trys
pop();
continue;
```

The remaining statements handle the point at which we exit a **protected region**
 Here we pop the
current **protected region** from the stack and spin the `while` statement to evaluate the current
operation again in the next **protected region** or at the function boundary


## Handling a completed generator
Once the generator has completed, the `_` state variable will be falsey
 As a result, the `while`
loop will terminate and hand control off to the final statement of the orchestration function,
which deals with how a completed generator is evaluated:

```ts
if (op[0] & 5)
    throw op[1];
return { value: op[0] ? op[1] : void 0, done: true };
```

If the caller calls `throw` on the generator it will send Opcode 1 (""throw"")
 If an exception
is uncaught within the body of the generator, it will send Opcode 6 (""catch"")
 As the generator has
completed, it throws the exception
 Both of these cases are caught by the bitmask `5`, which does
not collide with the only two other valid completion Opcodes


If the caller calls `next` on the generator, it will send Opcode 0 (""next"")
 As the generator has
completed, it returns an `IteratorResult` where `value` is `undefined` and `done` is true


If the caller calls `return` on the generator, it will send Opcode 2 (""return"")
 As the generator
has completed, it returns an `IteratorResult` where `value` is the value provided to `return`, and
`done` is true

# Constants

date-fns provides with a number of useful constants


## Usage

The constants could be imported from `date-fns/constants` or directly
from `date-fns`:

```js
import { maxTime } from 'date-fns/constants'
import { minTime } from 'date-fns'

function isAllowedTime(time) {
  return time <= maxTime && time >= minTime
}
```

## Constants

### `maxTime`

Maximum allowed time:

```js
import { maxTime } from 'date-fns'

const isValid = 8640000000000001 <= maxTime
//=> false

new Date(8640000000000001)
//=> Invalid Date
```

### `minTime`

Minimum allowed time:

```js
import { minTime } from 'date-fns'

const isValid = -8640000000000001 >= minTime
//=> false

new Date(-8640000000000001)
//=> Invalid Date
```

# ECMAScript Modules

**date-fns** v2
x provides support for
[ECMAScript Modules](http://www
ecma-international
org/ecma-262/6
0/#sec-modules)
that enables tree-shaking for bundlers, like [rollup
js](http://rollupjs
org)
and [webpack](https://webpack
js
org)


If you have tree-shaking enabled in your bundler, just import functions normally:

```javascript
import { format, parse } from 'date-fns'
import { enUS, eo } from 'date-fns/locale'
import { addDays, addHours } from 'date-fns/fp'
```

In TypeScript, now you can import individual functions in more idiomatic way:

```typescript
// Before
import * as format from 'date-fns/format'

// Now
import format from 'date-fns/format'
```

# FP Guide

**date-fns** v2
x provides [functional programming](https://en
wikipedia
org/wiki/Functional_programming) (FP)
friendly functions, like those in [lodash](https://github
com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide),
that support [currying](https://en
wikipedia
org/wiki/Currying)


## Table of Contents

- [Usage](#usage)

- [Using Function Composition](#using-function-composition)

## Usage

FP functions are provided via `'date-fns/fp'` submodule


Functions with options (`format`, `parse`, etc
) have two FP counterparts:
one that has the options object as its first argument and one that hasn't

The name of the former has `WithOptions` added to the end of its name


In **date-fns'** FP functions, the order of arguments is reversed


```javascript
import { addYears, formatWithOptions } from 'date-fns/fp'
import { eo } from 'date-fns/locale'
import toUpper from 'lodash/fp/toUpper' // 'date-fns/fp' is compatible with 'lodash/fp'!

// If FP function has not received enough arguments, it returns another function
const addFiveYears = addYears(5)

// Several arguments can be curried at once
const dateToString = formatWithOptions({ locale: eo }, 'd MMMM yyyy')

const dates = [
  new Date(2017, 0 /* Jan */, 1),
  new Date(2017, 1 /* Feb */, 11),
  new Date(2017, 6 /* Jul */, 2)
]

const formattedDates = dates
map(addFiveYears)
map(dateToString)
map(toUpper)
//=> ['1 JANUARO 2022', '11 FEBRUARO 2022', '2 JULIO 2022']
```

## Using Function Composition

The main advantage of FP functions is support of functional-style
[function composing](https://medium
com/making-internets/why-using-chain-is-a-mistake-9bc1f80d51ba)


In the example above, you can compose `addFiveYears`, `dateToString` and `toUpper` into a single function:

```javascript
const formattedDates = dates
map((date) => toUpper(dateToString(addFiveYears(date))))
```

Or you can use `compose` function provided by [lodash](https://lodash
com) to do the same in more idiomatic way:

```javascript
import compose from 'lodash/fp/compose'

const formattedDates = dates
map(compose(toUpper, dateToString, addFiveYears))
```

Or if you prefer natural direction of composing (as opposed to the computationally correct order),
you can use lodash' `flow` instead:

```javascript
import flow from 'lodash/fp/flow'

const formattedDates = dates
map(flow(addFiveYears, dateToString, toUpper))
```

```

## Submodules

**date-fns** includes some optional features as submodules in the npm package

Here is the list of them, in order of nesting:

- FP — functional programming-friendly variations of the functions
 See [FP Guide](https://date-fns
org/docs/FP-Guide);

- UTC (in development) — variations of the functions which calculate dates in UTC±00:00 timezone


The later submodules are also included inside the former if you want to use multiple features from the list


To use submodule features, [install the npm package](#npm) and then import a function from a submodule:

```js
// The main submodule:
import addDays from 'date-fns/addDays'

// FP variation:
import addDays from 'date-fns/fp/addDays'

// UTC variation:
import addDays from 'date-fns/utc/addDays'

// Both FP and UTC:
import addDays from 'date-fns/fp/utc/addDays'

// With tree-shaking enabled:
import { addDays, format } from 'date-fns/fp'
```

## Installation

The library is available as an [npm package](https://www
npmjs
com/package/date-fns)


To install the package, run:

```bash
npm install date-fns --save
# or
yarn add date-fns
```

Start using:

```js
import { formatDistance, subDays } from 'date-fns'

formatDistance(subDays(new Date(), 3), new Date(), { addSuffix: true })
//=> ""3 days ago""
```

# Internationalization

## Table of Contents

- [Usage](#usage)

- [Adding New Language](#adding-new-language)

## Usage

There are just a few functions that support I18n:

- [`format`](https://date-fns
org/docs/format)
- [`formatDistance`](https://date-fns
org/docs/formatDistance)
- [`formatDistanceStrict`](https://date-fns
org/docs/formatDistanceStrict)
- [`formatRelative`](https://date-fns
org/docs/formatRelative)

To use a locale, you need to require it and then pass
as an option to a function:

```js
import { formatDistance } from 'date-fns'
// Require Esperanto locale
import { eo } from 'date-fns/locale'

const result = formatDistance(
  new Date(2016, 7, 1),
  new Date(2015, 0, 1),
  {locale: eo} // Pass the locale as an option
)
//=> 'pli ol 1 jaro'
```

It might seem complicated to require and pass locales as options,
but unlike Moment
js which bloats your build with all the locales
by default date-fns forces developer to manually require locales when needed

To make API simple, we encourage you to write tiny wrappers and use those
instead of original functions:

```js
// app/_lib/format
js

import { format } from 'date-fns'
import { enGB, eo, ru } from 'date-fns/locale'

const locales = {enGB, eo, ru}

// by providing a default string of 'PP' or any of its variants for `formatStr`
// it will format dates in whichever way is appropriate to the locale
export default function (date, formatStr = 'PP') {
  return format(date, formatStr, {
    locale: locales[window
__localeId__] // or global
__localeId__
  })
}

// Later:

import format from 'app/_lib/format'

window
__localeId__ = 'enGB'
format(friday13, 'EEEE d')
//=> 'Friday 13'

window
__localeId__ = 'eo'
format(friday13, 'EEEE d')
//=> 'vendredo 13'

// If the format string is omitted, it will take the default for the locale

window
__localeId__ = 'enGB'
format(friday13)
//=> Jul 13, 2019

window
__localeId__ = 'eo'
format(friday13)
//=> 2019-jul-13

```

## Adding New Language

At the moment there is no definitive guide, so if you feel brave enough,
use this quick guide:

- First of all, [create an issue](https://github
com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/new?title=XXX%20language%20support)
  so you won't overlap with others

- A detailed explanation of how to [add a new locale](https://github
com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/i18nContributionGuide
md#adding-a-new-locale)

- Use [English locale](https://github
com/date-fns/date-fns/tree/master/src/locale/en-US)
  as the basis and then incrementally adjust the tests and the code

- Directions on [adding a locale with the same language as another locale](https://github
com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/i18nContributionGuide
md#creating-a-locale-with-the-same-language-as-another-locale)

- If you have questions or need guidance, leave a comment in the issue


Thank you for your support!

## Adding a new locale

To add a new locale:

- [Choose a directory name for it](#choosing-a-directory-name-for-a-locale)


- Copy the content of an existing locale (e
g
 `en-US`) into the newly created directory


- Replace the values in the content with yours file-by-file

  Use [CLDR data](https://www
unicode
html)
  as a point of reference which values to choose


All locales contain a number of properties:

- [`formatDistance`](#formatdistance) — distance localizer function used by `formatDistance` and `formatDistanceStrict`

- [`formatLong`](#formatlong) — contains long date localizer functions used by `format` and `formatRelative`

- [`formatRelative`](#formatrelative) — relative date localizer function used by `formatRelative`

- [`localize`](#localize) — contains functions, which localize the various date values
 Required by `format` and `formatRelative`

- [`match`](#match) — contains functions to parse date values
 Required by `parse`

- [`options`](#indexjs) — contains the index of the first day of the week for functions such as `startOfWeek`,
  and the value which determines the first week of the year
  for functions like `setWeek`


### Choosing a directory name for a locale

Use the four letter code for the directory name (e
g
 `en-GB`),

Use the two/three letter code:

- if the language code and the country code are the same (e
g
 `pt` instead of `pt-PT`)


- if the language is used in only one country (e
g
 `fil` instead of `fil-PH`)


- if all countries who use the language
also use the same regional standards: the first day of the week,
the week numbering (see: https://en
wikipedia
org/wiki/Week#Week_numbering),
calendar date format (see: https://en
wikipedia
org/wiki/Calendar_date)
and date representation (see: https://en
wikipedia
org/wiki/Date_and_time_representation_by_country
and: https://en
wikipedia
org/wiki/Date_format_by_country)
(e
g
 `ca` instead of `ca-ES` and `ca-AD`)


### index
js

Locale's `index
js` is where all the properties of the locale are combined in a single file,
documented in JSDoc format


```javascript
import formatDistance from '
/_lib/formatDistance/index
js'
import formatLong from '
/_lib/formatLong/index
js'
import formatRelative from '
/_lib/formatRelative/index
js'
import localize from '
/_lib/localize/index
js'
import match from '
/_lib/match/index
js'

/**

### localize

Put this object in `_lib/localize/index
js` inside your locale directory
ordinalNumber

Function that takes a numeric argument and returns a string with ordinal number:

```js
// In `en-US` locale:
function ordinalNumber (dirtyNumber, dirtyOptions) {
  var number = Number(dirtyNumber)

  var rem100 = number % 100
  if (rem100 > 20 || rem100 < 10) {
    switch (rem100 % 10) {
      case 1:
        return number + 'st'
      case 2:
        return number + 'nd'
      case 3:
        return number + 'rd'
    }
  }
  return number + 'th'
}

var localize = {
  ordinalNumber: ordinalNumber,
  // 



}
```

If the form of the ordinal number depends on the grammatical case (or other grammatical structures),
use `options
unit` argument which could be one of the values 'year', 'quarter', 'month', 'week',
'date', 'dayOfYear', 'day', 'hour', 'minute' or 'second':

```js
// In `ru` locale:
function ordinalNumber (dirtyNumber, dirtyOptions) {
  var options = dirtyOptions || {}
  var unit = String(options
unit)
  var suffix

  if (unit === 'date') {
    suffix = '-е'
  } else if (unit === 'week' || unit === 'minute' || unit === 'second') {
    suffix = '-я'
  } else {
    suffix = '-й'
  }

  return dirtyNumber + suffix
}
```

#### localize
era and using buildLocalizeFn function

Localizes a numeric era
 Takes either 0 or 1 as the first argument

As with many of the `localize` functions, they can be generated by built-in
`buildLocalizeFn` function


From the CLDR chart, use ['Date & Time'/'Gregorian'/'Eras'](https://www
unicode
org/cldr/charts/32/summary/en
html#1771) values


```js
// In `en-US` locale:
import buildLocalizeFn from '

/

/

/_lib/buildLocalizeFn/index



  era: buildLocalizeFn({
    values: eraValues,
    defaultWidth: 'wide'
  }),
  // 



}

export default localize
```

General usage of the function:

```js
var result = locale
localize
era(1, {width: 'abbreviated'})
//=> 'AD'
```

If `width` is not provided or the `values` object does not contain values for the provided width,
`defaultWidth` will be used
 `defaultWidth` should indicate the longest form of the localized value

The same is true for all other `localize` functions

`width` for `localize
era` function could be either 'narrow', 'abbreviated' or 'wide'


```js
var result = locale
localize
era(1, {width: 'foobar'})
//=> 'Anno Domini'
```

#### Formatting localizers

For some languages, there is a difference between ""stand-alone"" localizers and ""formatting"" localizers

""Stand-alone"" means that the resulting value should make grammatical sense without context

""Formatting"" means that the resulting value should be declined using the grammar rules of the language
as if the value was a part of a date

For example, for languages with grammatical cases, the stand-alone month could be in the nominative case (""January""),
and the formatting month could decline as a part of the phrase ""1st of January""

In this case, use parameters `formattingValues` and `defaultFormattingWidth` of `buildLocalizeFn` function


Any localizer could be stand-alone and formatting

Check the CLDR chart for the unit to see if stand-alone and formatting values are different for a certain unit

If there's no difference (usually it happens in languages without grammatical cases),
parameters `formattingValues` and `defaultFormattingWidth` are not needed


In this example, in Russian language a stand-alone month is in the nominative case (""январь""),
and formatting month is in the genitive case (""января"" as in ""1-е января"")
 Notice the different endings:

```js
// In `ru` locale:
var monthValues = {
  narrow: ['Я', 'Ф', 'М', 'А', 'М', 'И', 'И', 'А', 'С', 'О', 'Н', 'Д'],
  abbreviated: ['янв
', 'фев
', 'март', 'апр
', 'май', 'июнь', 'июль', 'авг
', 'сент
', 'окт
', 'нояб
', 'дек
'],
  wide: ['январь', 'февраль', 'март', 'апрель', 'май', 'июнь', 'июль', 'август', 'сентябрь', 'октябрь', 'ноябрь', 'декабрь']
}
var formattingMonthValues = {
  narrow: ['Я', 'Ф', 'М', 'А', 'М', 'И', 'И', 'А', 'С', 'О', 'Н', 'Д'],
  abbreviated: ['янв
', 'фев
', 'мар
', 'апр
', 'мая', 'июн
', 'июл
', 'авг
', 'сент
', 'окт
', 'нояб
', 'дек
'],
  wide: ['января', 'февраля', 'марта', 'апреля', 'мая', 'июня', 'июля', 'августа', 'сентября', 'октября', 'ноября', 'декабря']
}

var localize = {
  // 



  month: buildLocalizeFn({
    values: monthValues,
    defaultWidth: 'wide',
    formattingValues: formattingMonthValues,
    defaultFormattingWidth: 'wide'
  }),
  // 



}

export default localize
```

#### localize
quarter

Localizes a quarter
 Takes 1, 2, 3 or 4 as the first argument

`width` could be either 'narrow', 'abbreviated' or 'wide'

From the CLDR chart, use ['Date & Time'/'Gregorian'/'Quarters'](https://www
unicode
org/cldr/charts/32/summary/en
html#1781) values


```js
// In `en-US` locale:
import buildLocalizeFn from '

/

/

/_lib/buildLocalizeFn/index



  quarter: buildLocalizeFn({
    values: quarterValues,
    defaultWidth: 'wide',
    argumentCallback: function (quarter) {
      return Number(quarter) - 1
    }
  }),
  // 



}

export default localize
```

Note the usage of `argumentCallback` here
 It converts the value passed into `localize
quarter` function
(one of 1, 2, 3 or 4) into the index of the values array inside `quarterValues` (one of 0, 1, 2 or 3)


#### localize
month

Localizes a month
 Takes numbers between 0 (for January) and 11 (for December)

`width` could be either 'narrow', 'abbreviated' or 'wide'

From the CLDR chart, use ['Date & Time'/'Gregorian'/'Months'](https://www
unicode
org/cldr/charts/32/summary/en
html#1793) values


```js
// In `en-US` locale:
import buildLocalizeFn from '

/

/

/_lib/buildLocalizeFn/index
js'

var monthValues = {
  narrow: ['J', 'F', 'M', 'A', 'M', 'J', 'J', 'A', 'S', 'O', 'N', 'D'],
  abbreviated: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'],
  wide: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']
}

var localize = {
  // 



  month: buildLocalizeFn({
    values: monthValues,
    defaultWidth: 'wide'
  }),
  // 



}

export default localize
```

**NOTE**: in English, the names of days of the week and months are capitalized

Check if the same is true for the language you're working on

Generally, formatted dates should look like they are in the middle of a sentence,
e
g
 in Spanish language the weekdays and months should be in the lowercase:

```js
// In `es` locale:
var monthValues = {
  narrow: ['E', 'F', 'M', 'A', 'M', 'J', 'J', 'A', 'S', 'O', 'N', 'D'],
  abbreviated: ['ene
', 'feb
', 'mar
', 'abr
', 'may
', 'jun
', 'jul
', 'ago
', 'sep
', 'oct
', 'nov
', 'dic
'],
  wide: ['enero', 'febrero', 'marzo', 'abril', 'mayo', 'junio', 'julio', 'agosto', 'septiembre', 'octubre', 'noviembre', 'diciembre']
}
```

`monthValues
narrow` are usually capitalized in every language
 Check the CLDR chart for your language


#### localize
day

Localizes a week day
 Takes numbers between 0 (for Sunday) and 6 (for Saturday)

`width` could be either 'narrow', 'short', 'abbreviated' or 'wide'

From the CLDR chart, use ['Date & Time'/'Gregorian'/'Days'](https://www
unicode
org/cldr/charts/32/summary/en
html#1829) values


```js
// In `en-US` locale:
import buildLocalizeFn from '

/

/

/_lib/buildLocalizeFn/index
js'

var dayValues = {
  narrow: ['S', 'M', 'T', 'W', 'T', 'F', 'S'],
  short: ['Su', 'Mo', 'Tu', 'We', 'Th', 'Fr', 'Sa'],
  abbreviated: ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat'],
  wide: ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday']
}

var localize = {
  // 



  day: buildLocalizeFn({
    values: dayValues,
    defaultWidth: 'wide'
  }),
  // 



}

export default localize
```

**NOTE**: the rules of capitalization from `localize
month` are also true for `localize
day`


#### localize
dayPeriod

Localizes a certain day period

Could take one of these strings as the argument: 'am', 'pm', 'midnight', 'noon', 'morning', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'night'

`width` could be either 'narrow', 'abbreviated' or 'wide'

From the CLDR chart, use ['Date & Time'/'Gregorian'/'Day periods'](https://www
unicode
org/cldr/charts/32/summary/en
html#1857) values


```js
// In `en-US` locale:
import buildLocalizeFn from '

/

/

/_lib/buildLocalizeFn/index
m
',
    pm: 'p
m
',
    midnight: 'midnight',
    noon: 'noon',
    morning: 'in the morning',
    afternoon: 'in the afternoon',
    evening: 'in the evening',
    night: 'at night'
  }
}

var localize = {
  // 


js` inside your locale directory

Locale date formats written in `format` token string format

See the list of tokens: https://date-fns
org/docs/format
Use https://en
wikipedia
org/wiki/Date_format_by_country and CLDR chart as the reference


#### formatLong
dateFormats

Use ['Date & Time'/'Gregorian'/'Formats - Standard - Date Formats'](https://www
unicode
org/cldr/charts/32/summary/en
html#1901) values
from the CLDR chart as a reference


```js
// In `en-US` locale
import buildFormatLongFn from '

/

/

/_lib/buildFormatLongFn/index
js'

var dateFormats = {
  full: 'EEEE, MMMM do, y',
  long: 'MMMM do, y',
  medium: 'MMM d, y',
  short: 'MM/dd/yyyy'
}

var formatLong = {
  date: buildFormatLongFn({
    formats: dateFormats,
    defaultWidth: 'full'
  }),
  // 



}

export default formatLong
```

`dateFormats
long` usually contains the longest form of writing the year, the month, and the day of the month

Use ordinal day of the month ('do' token) where applicable (date-fns, unlike CLDR supports ordinal numbers)


`dateFormats
full` contains the same but with the day of the week


`dateFormats
medium` contains the same values as `dateFormats
long`, but with short form of month and non-ordinal day


`dateFormats
short` usually contains a strictly numerical form of the date

Pay attention to the order of units (big-, little- or middle-endian)

#### formatLong
timeFormats

Use ['Date & Time'/'Gregorian'/'Formats - Standard - Time Formats'](https://www
unicode
org/cldr/charts/32/summary/en
html#1906) values
from the CLDR chart as a reference


Use some variation of 'h:mm aa' for 12-hour clock locales or 'H:mm' for 24-hour clock locales
 Use the local time separator


```js
// In `en-US` locale
import buildFormatLongFn from '

/

/

/_lib/buildFormatLongFn/index





}

export default formatLong
```

#### formatLong
dateTimeFormats

Use
['Date & Time'/'Gregorian'/'Formats - Standard - Date & Time Combination Formats'](https://www
unicode
org/cldr/charts/32/summary/en
html#1910)
values from the CLDR chart


```js
// In `en-US` locale
import buildFormatLongFn from '

/

/

/_lib/buildFormatLongFn/index
js'

var dateTimeFormats = {
  full: ""{{date}} 'at' {{time}}"",
  long: ""{{date}} 'at' {{time}}"",
  medium: '{{date}}, {{time}}',
  short: '{{date}}, {{time}}'
}

var formatLong = {
  // 




### formatRelative

Put this function in `_lib/formatRelative/index
js` inside your locale directory

Relative date formats written in `format` token string format

See the list of tokens: https://date-fns
org/docs/format

Has to process `lastWeek`, `yesterday`, `today`, `tomorrow`, `nextWeek` and `other` tokens


```javascript
// In `en-US` locale
var formatRelativeLocale = {
  lastWeek: ""'last' eeee 'at' p"",
  yesterday: ""'yesterday at' p"",
  today: ""'today at' p"",
  tomorrow: ""'tomorrow at' p"",
  nextWeek: ""eeee 'at' p"",
  other: 'P'
}

export default function formatRelative (token, date, baseDate, options) {
  return formatRelativeLocale[token]
}
```

You can use `date` and `baseDate` supplied to the function for the difficult situations
(e
g
 grammatical genders and cases of the days of the week)
Both `date` and `baseDate` are converted to UTC timezone, which means
that you should use UTC methods to take the date values (i
e
 `date
getUTCDay()` instead of `date
getDay()`)

You can use UTC functions from `src/_lib` in date-fns root directory if they are available

Don't forget to pass `options` object to them!
Example is below
 Note the different grammatical case for weekdays (accusative instead of nominative)
and declension of word ""прошлый"" which depends on the grammatical gender of the weekday:

```javascript
// In `ru` locale
import isSameUTCWeek from '

/

/

/

/_lib/isSameUTCWeek/index
js'

var accusativeWeekdays = ['воскресенье', 'понедельник', 'вторник', 'среду', 'четверг', 'пятницу', 'субботу']

function lastWeek (day) {
  var weekday = accusativeWeekdays[day]

  switch (day) {
    case 0:
      return ""'в прошлое "" + weekday + "" в' p""
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 4:
      return ""'в прошлый "" + weekday + "" в' p""
    case 3:
    case 5:
    case 6:
      return ""'в прошлую "" + weekday + "" в' p""
  }
}

function thisWeek (day) {
  // 



}

function nextWeek (day) {
  // 



}

var formatRelativeLocale = {
  lastWeek: function (date, baseDate, options) {
    var day = date
getUTCDay()
    if (isSameUTCWeek(date, baseDate, options)) {
      return thisWeek(day)
    } else {
      return lastWeek(day)
    }
  },
  yesterday: ""'вчера в' p"",
  today: ""'сегодня в' p"",
  tomorrow: ""'завтра в' p"",
  nextWeek: function (date, baseDate, options) {
    var day = date
getUTCDay()
    if (isSameUTCWeek(date, baseDate, options)) {
      return thisWeek(day)
    } else {
      return nextWeek(day)
    }
  },
  other: 'P'
}

export default function formatRelative (token, date, baseDate, options) {
  var format = formatRelativeLocale[token]

  if (typeof format === 'function') {
    return format(date, baseDate, options)
  }

  return format
}
```

### match

Put this object in `_lib/match/index
js` inside your locale directory

Contains the functions used by `parse` to parse a localized value:

```js
// In `en-US` locale:
import buildMatchPatternFn from '

/

export default match
```

These functions mirror those in `localize`


For `matchPatterns` the patterns should match the whole meaningful word for the parsed value
(which will be cut from the string in the process of parsing)

`parsePatterns` contains patterns to detect one of the values from the result of `matchPatterns`
Note that the patterns for `parsePatterns` don't necessary contain the whole word:

```javascript
// In `en-US` locale:
var parseDayPatterns = {
  narrow: [/^s/i, /^m/i, /^t/i, /^w/i, /^t/i, /^f/i, /^s/i],
  any: [/^su/i, /^m/i, /^tu/i, /^w/i, /^th/i, /^f/i, /^sa/i]
}
```

but only the bare minimum to parse the value


Also note that all patterns have ""case-insensitive"" flags
to match as much arbitrary user input as possible
 For the same reason, try to match
any variation of diacritical marks:

```javascript
// In `eo` locale:
var matchDayPatterns = {
  narrow: /^[dlmĵjvs]/i,
  short: /^(di|lu|ma|me|(ĵ|jx|jh|j)a|ve|sa)/i,
  abbreviated: /^(dim|lun|mar|mer|(ĵ|jx|jh|j)a(ŭ|ux|uh|u)|ven|sab)/i,
  wide: /^(diman(ĉ|cx|ch|c)o|lundo|mardo|merkredo|(ĵ|jx|jh|j)a(ŭ|ux|uh|u)do|vendredo|sabato)/i
}
var parseDayPatterns = {
  narrow: [/^d/i, /^l/i, /^m/i, /^m/i, /^(j|ĵ)/i, /^v/i, /^s/i],
  any: [/^d/i, /^l/i, /^ma/i, /^me/i, /^(j|ĵ)/i, /^v/i, /^s/i]
}
```

Here, for the word ""dimanĉo"" the functions will match also ""dimancxo"", ""dimancho""
and even grammatically incorrect ""dimanco""


Try to match any possible way of writing the word
 Don't forget the grammatical cases:

```javascript
// In `ru` locale:
var matchMonthPatterns = {
  narrow: /^[яфмаисонд]/i,
  abbreviated: /^(янв|фев|март?|апр|ма[йя]|июн[ья]?|июл[ья]?|авг|сент?|окт|нояб?|дек)/i,
  wide: /^(январ[ья]|феврал[ья]|марта?|апрел[ья]|ма[йя]|июн[ья]|июл[ья]|августа?|сентябр[ья]|октябр[ья]|октябр[ья]|ноябр[ья]|декабр[ья])/i
}
```

and variations of short weekdays and months:

```javascript
// In `ru` locale:
var matchDayPatterns = {
  narrow: /^[впсч]/i,
  short: /^(вс|во|пн|по|вт|ср|чт|че|пт|пя|сб|су)\
?/i,
  abbreviated: /^(вск|вос|пнд|пон|втр|вто|срд|сре|чтв|чет|птн|пят|суб)
?/i,
  wide: /^(воскресень[ея]|понедельника?|вторника?|сред[аы]|четверга?|пятниц[аы]|суббот[аы])/i
}
```

(here, the `abbreviated` pattern will match both `вск` and `вос` as the short of `воскресенье` {Sunday})

In `match
ordinalNumber` match ordinal numbers as well as non-ordinal numbers:

```javascript
// In `en-US` locale:
var matchOrdinalNumberPattern = /^(\d+)(th|st|nd|rd)?/i
```

Don't forget the grammatical genders:

```javascript
// In `ru` locale:
var matchOrdinalNumberPattern = /^(\d+)(-?(е|я|й|ое|ье|ая|ья|ый|ой|ий|ый))?/i
```

### formatDistance

`formatDistance` property of locale is a function which takes three arguments:
token passed by date-fns' `formatDistance` function (e
g
 'lessThanXMinutes'),
a number of units to be displayed by the function
(e
g
 `locale


Your best guess is to copy `formatDistance` property from another locale and change the values


### Tests

To test locales we use snapshots
 See [`en-US` snapshot](https://github
com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/src/locale/en-US/snapshot
md) for an example


To generate snapshots, run `yarn locale-snapshots`
 The snapshot for the locale
you're working on will appear in the root locale directory (e
g
 `src/locales/ru/snapshot
md`)


Once you are done with the locale, generate the snapshot and review the output values


## Creating a locale with the same language as another locale

Import the locale properties already implemented for the language,
but replace unique properties


```javascript
// Same as en-US
import formatDistance from '

/en-US/_lib/formatDistance/index
js'
import formatRelative from '

/en-US/_lib/formatRelative/index
js'
import localize from '

/en-US/_lib/localize/index
js'
import match from '

/en-US/_lib/match/index
js'

// Unique for en-GB
import formatLong from '
/_lib/formatLong/index
js'

/**
 * @type {Locale}
 * @category Locales
 * @summary English locale (United Kingdom)

 * @language English
 * @iso-639-2 eng
 * @author John Doe [@example]{@link https://github
com/example}
 */
var locale = {
  formatDistance: formatDistance,
  formatLong: formatLong,
  formatRelative: formatRelative,
  localize: localize,
  match: match,

  // Unique for en-GB
  options: {
    weekStartsOn: 1,
    firstWeekContainsDate: 4
  }
}

export default locale
```

# Releasing date-fns

1
 First, make sure that the library is built by running `
/scripts/build/build
sh` and committing and pushing any change you would have


2
 Then add the changelog entry generated by `yarn ts-node scripts/release/buildChangelog
ts` to [CHANGELOG
md](

md)
 Commit and push the file


3
 Using the version that the changelog script generated, run the command:

   ```bash
   env VERSION=""vX
XX
X"" APP_ENV=""production"" GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=""secrets/production/key
json"" 
/scripts/release/release
sh
   ```

   The script will change `package
json`
 **Do not commit the change, and reset it instead**


4
 Now when the package is published, go to [GitHub Releases](https://github
com/date-fns/date-fns/releases) and draft a new version using the changelog entry you generated earlier


5
 Finally, write an announce tweet using the created GitHub release as the tweet link


You're done, great job!

# Time Zones

## Table of Contents

- [Overview](#overview)

- [`date-fns-tz`](#date-fns-tz)

## Overview

Working with UTC or ISO date strings is easy, and so is working with JS dates when all times
are displayed in a user's local time in the browser
 The difficulty comes when working with another
time zone's local time, other than the current system's, like showing the local time of an event in LA
at 8pm PST on a Node server in Europe or a user's machine set to EST


In this case there are two relevant pieces of information:

- a fixed moment in time in the form of a timestamp, UTC or ISO date string, and
- the time zone descriptor, usually an offset or IANA time zone name (e
g
 `America/Los_Angeles`)


Libraries like Moment and Luxon, which provide their own date time classes, manage these timestamp and time
zone values internally


## [`date-fns-tz`](https://www
npmjs
com/package/date-fns-tz)

Dependency free IANA time zone support is implemented via the
[Intl API](https://developer
mozilla
org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) to keep
actual time zone data out of code bundles
 Modern browsers all support the
[necessary features](https://developer
mozilla


Functions are provided for converting to and from a Date instance which will have the internal UTC time
adjusted so it prints to the correct time value in the associated time zone, regardless of the current
system time zone


zzzz` tokens to
format long and short time zone names


Compatible with `date-fns` version 2

License: MIT

### Synopsis

```js
const { zonedTimeToUtc, utcToZonedTime, format } = require('date-fns-tz')

// Set the date to ""2018-09-01T16:01:36
386Z""
const utcDate = zonedTimeToUtc('2018-09-01 18:01:36
386', 'Europe/Berlin')

// Obtain a Date instance that will render the equivalent Berlin time for the UTC date
const date = new Date('2018-09-01T16:01:36
386Z')
const timeZone = 'Europe/Berlin'
const zonedDate = utcToZonedTime(date, timeZone)
// zonedDate could be used to initialize a date picker or display the formatted local date/time

// Set the output to ""1
9
2018 18:01:36
386 GMT+02:00 (CEST)""
const pattern = 'd
M
yyyy HH:mm:ss
SSS \'GMT\' XXX (z)'
const output = format(zonedDate, pattern, { timeZone: 'Europe/Berlin' })
```

# Unicode Tokens

Starting with v2, `format` and `parse` use [Unicode tokens]


The tokens are different from Moment
js and other libraries that opted to use
custom formatting rules
 While usage of a standard ensures compatibility and
the future of the library, it causes confusion that this document intends
to resolve


## Popular mistakes

There are 4 tokens that cause most of the confusion:

- `D` and `DD` that represent the day of a year (1, 2, 




, 31)


- `YY` and `YYYY` that represent the local week-numbering year (44, 01, 00, 17)
  are often confused with `yy` and `yyyy` that represent the calendar year
02
87', 'D
MM
YY', new Date())
02
87', 'd
MM
yy', new Date())
toString()
//=> 'Wed Feb 11 1987 00:00:00 GMT+0200 (EET)'
```

To help with the issue, `format` and `parse` functions won't accept
these tokens without `useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens` option for `D` and `DD` and
`useAdditionalWeekYearTokens` options for `YY` and `YYYY`:

```js
format(new Date(), 'D', { useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens: true })
//=> '283'

parse('365+1987', 'DD+YYYY', new Date(), {
  useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens: true,
  useAdditionalWeekYearTokens: true
})
toString()
//=> 'Wed Dec 31 1986 00:00:00 GMT+0200 (EET)'
```

# v2 Upgrade Guide

## Common changes

This page covers a few of the most common problems people face when updating from v1 to v2
 For a more detailed list of changes, look at the [change log for version 2
0
0](https://date-fns
org/docs/Change-Log)


### Camel case naming schema

Function submodules now use camelCase naming schema:

```javascript
// Before v2
0
0
import differenceInCalendarISOYears from 'date-fns/difference_in_calendar_iso_years'

// v2
0


See [Unicode Tokens doc](https://date-fns
org/docs/Unicode-Tokens) for more details


### String arguments

Functions now don't accept strings as date arguments
 Strings should
be parsed using `parseISO` (ISO 8601) or `parse`


See [this post](https://blog
date-fns
org/post/we-cut-date-fns-v2-minimal-build-size-down-to-300-bytes-and-now-its-the-smallest-date-library-18f2nvh2z0yal) for more details


```javascript
// Before v2
0
0
addDays('2016-01-01', 1)

// v2
0
0 onward
addDays(parseISO('2016-01-01'), 1)
```

### Arguments conversion

All functions now implicitly convert arguments by following rules:

|           | date         | number | string      | boolean |
| --------- | ------------ | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| 0         | new Date(0)  | 0      | '0'         | false   |
| '0'       | Invalid Date | 0      | '0'         | false   |
| 1         | new Date(1)  | 1      | '1'         | true    |
| '1'       | Invalid Date | 1      | '1'         | true    |
| true      | Invalid Date | NaN    | 'true'      | true    |
| false     | Invalid Date | NaN    | 'false'     | false   |
| null      | Invalid Date | NaN    | 'null'      | false   |
| undefined | Invalid Date | NaN    | 'undefined' | false   |
| NaN       | Invalid Date | NaN    | 'NaN'       | false   |

Notes:

- as before, arguments expected to be `Date` are converted to `Date` using _date-fns'_ `toDate` function;
- arguments expected to be numbers are converted to integer numbers using our custom `toInteger` implementation
  (see [#765](https://github
com/date-fns/date-fns/pull/765));
- arguments expected to be strings are converted to strings using JavaScript's `String` function;
- arguments expected to be booleans are converted to boolean using JavaScript's `Boolean` function


`null` and `undefined` passed to optional arguments (i
e
 properties of `options` argument)
are ignored as if no argument was passed


If any argument is invalid (i
e
 `NaN` for numbers and `Invalid Date` for dates),
an invalid value will be returned:

- `false` for functions that return booleans (expect `isValid`);
- `Invalid Date` for functions that return dates;
- `NaN` for functions that return numbers;
- and `String('Invalid Date')` for functions that return strings


See tests and PRs [#460](https://github
com/date-fns/date-fns/pull/460) and
[#765](https://github
com/date-fns/date-fns/pull/765) for exact behavior


### `null`

`null` now is not a valid date
 `isValid(null)` returns `false`;
`toDate(null)` returns an invalid date
 Since `toDate` is used internally
by all the functions, operations over `null` will also return an invalid date

[See #537](https://github
com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/537) for the reasoning


### `RangeError`

Functions now throw `RangeError` if optional values passed to `options`
are not `undefined` or have expected values

This change is introduced for consistency with ECMAScript standard library which does the same


### `TypeError`

All functions now check if the passed number of arguments is less
than the number of required arguments and throw `TypeError` exception if so


### UMD/CDN

The Bower & UMD/CDN package versions are no longer supported


### New locale format

See [docs/Locale](https://date-fns
org/docs/Locale)


Locales renamed:

- `en` → `en-US`
- `zh_cn` → `zh-CN`
- `zh_tw` → `zh-TW`

```javascript
// Before v2
0
0
import locale from 'date-fns/locale/zh_cn'

// v2
0
0 onward
import locale from 'date-fns/locale/zh-CN'
```

# webpack

## Removing unused languages from dynamic import

If a locale is imported dynamically, then all locales from date-fns are loaded by webpack into a bundle (~160kb) or split across the chunks
 This prolongs the build process and increases the amount of space taken
 However, it is possible to use webpack to trim down languages using [ContextReplacementPlugin]


Let's assume that we have a single point in which supported locales are present:

`config
js`:

```js
// `see date-fns/src/locale` for available locales
export const supportedLocales = ['en-US', 'de', 'pl', 'it']
```

We could also have a function that formats the date:

```js
const getLocale = (locale) => import(`date-fns/locale/${locale}/index
js`) // or require() if using CommonJS

const formatDate = (date, formatStyle, locale) => {
  return format(date, formatStyle, {
    locale: getLocale(locale),
  })
}
```

In order to exclude unused languages we can use webpacks [ContextReplacementPlugin]


`webpack
config
js`:

```js
import webpack from 'webpack'
import { supportedLocales } from '
/config
js'

export default const config = {
  plugins: [
    new webpack
ContextReplacementPlugin(
      /^date-fns[/\\]locale$/,
      new RegExp(`\\
[/\\\\](${supportedLocales
join('|')})[/\\\\]index\\
js$`)
    )
  ]
}
```

This results in a language bundle of ~23kb

The main error here is:

```
Error: ""pre"" versions of node cannot be installed, use the --nodedir flag instead
```

This error is caused when you attempt to compile a native addon using a version of node
js with `-pre` at the end of the version number:

``` bash
$ node -v
v0
10
4-pre
```

## How to avoid (the short answer)

To avoid this error completely just use a stable release of node
js
 i
e
 `v0
10
4`, and __not__ `v0
10
4-pre`


## How to fix (the long answer)

This error happens because `node-gyp` does not know what header files were used to compile your ""pre"" version of node, and therefore it needs you to specify the node source code directory path using the `--nodedir` flag


For example, if I compiled my development (""pre"") version of node
js using the source code in `/Users/nrajlich/node`, then I could invoke `node-gyp` like:

``` bash
$ node-gyp rebuild --nodedir=/Users/nrajlich/node
```

Or install an native addon through `npm` like:

``` bash
$ npm install bcrypt --nodedir=/Users/nrajlich/node
```

### Always use `--nodedir`

__Note:__ This is for advanced users who use `-pre` versions of node more often than tagged releases


If you're invoking `node-gyp` through `npm`, then you can leverage `npm`'s configuration system and not have to specify the `--nodedir` flag all the time:

``` bash
$ npm config set nodedir /Users/nrajlich/node
```
# Force npm to use global installed node-gyp

**Note: These instructions only work with npm 6 or older
 For a solution that works with npm 8 (or older), see [Updating-npm-bundled-node-gyp
md](Updating-npm-bundled-node-gyp
md)
**

[Many issues](https://github
1
0) are opened by users who are
not running a [current version of node-gyp](https://github
com/nodejs/node-gyp/releases)


npm bundles its own, internal, copy of node-gyp located at `npm/node_modules`, within npm's private dependencies which are separate from *globally* accessible packages
 Therefore this internal copy of node-gyp is independent from any globally installed copy of node-gyp that
may have been installed via `npm install -g node-gyp`


So npm's internal copy of node-gyp **isn't** stored inside *global* `node_modules` and thus isn't available for use as a standalone package
 npm uses it's *internal* copy of `node-gyp` to automatically build native addons


When you install a _new_ version of node-gyp outside of npm, it'll go into your *global* `node_modules`, but not under the `npm/node_modules` (where internal copy of node-gyp is stored)
 So it will get into your `$PATH` and you will be able to use this globally installed version (**but not internal node-gyp of npm**) as any other globally installed package


The catch is that npm **won't** use global version unless you tell it to, it'll keep on using the **internal one**
 You need to instruct it to by setting the `node_gyp` config variable (which goes into your `~/
npmrc`)
 You do this by running the `npm config set` command as below
 Then npm will use the command in the path you supply whenever it needs to build a native addon


**Important**: You also need to remember to unset this when you upgrade npm with a newer version of node-gyp, or you have to manually keep your globally installed node-gyp to date
 See ""Undo"" below


## Linux and macOS
```
npm install --global node-gyp@latest
npm config set node_gyp $(npm prefix -g)/lib/node_modules/node-gyp/bin/node-gyp
js
```

`sudo` may be required for the first command if you get a permission error


## Windows

### Windows Command Prompt
```
npm install --global node-gyp@latest
for /f ""delims="" %P in ('npm prefix -g') do npm config set node_gyp ""%P\node_modules\node-gyp\bin\node-gyp
js""
```

### Powershell
```
npm install --global node-gyp@latest
npm prefix -g | % {npm config set node_gyp ""$_\node_modules\node-gyp\bin\node-gyp
js""}
```

## Undo
**Beware** if you don't unset the `node_gyp` config option, npm will continue to use the globally installed version of node-gyp rather than the one it ships with, which may end up being newer


```
npm config delete node_gyp
npm uninstall --global node-gyp
```

Welcome to the node-gyp wiki!

 * [[""binding
gyp"" files out in the wild]]
 * [[Linking to OpenSSL]]
 * [[Common Issues]]
 * [[Updating npm's bundled node-gyp]]
 * [[Error: ""pre"" versions of node cannot be installed]]

A handful of native addons require linking to OpenSSL in one way or another
 This introduces a small challenge since node will sometimes bundle OpenSSL statically (the default for node >= v0
8
x), or sometimes dynamically link to the system OpenSSL (default for node <= v0
6
x)


Good native addons should account for both scenarios
 It's recommended that you use the `binding
gyp` file provided below as a starting-point for any addon that needs to use OpenSSL:

``` python
{
  'variables': {
    # node v0
6
x doesn't give us its build variables,
    # but on Unix it was only possible to use the system OpenSSL library,
    # so default the variable to ""true"", v0
8
x node and up will overwrite it

    'node_shared_openssl%': 'true'
  },
  'targets': [
    {
      'target_name': 'binding',
      'sources': [
        'src/binding
cc'
      ],
      'conditions': [
        ['node_shared_openssl==""false""', {
          # so when ""node_shared_openssl"" is ""false"", then OpenSSL has been
          # bundled into the node executable
 So we need to include the same
          # header files that were used when building node

          'include_dirs': [
            '<(node_root_dir)/deps/openssl/openssl/include'
          ],
          ""conditions"" : [
            [""target_arch=='ia32'"", {
              ""include_dirs"": [ ""<(node_root_dir)/deps/openssl/config/piii"" ]
            }],
            [""target_arch=='x64'"", {
              ""include_dirs"": [ ""<(node_root_dir)/deps/openssl/config/k8"" ]
            }],
            [""target_arch=='arm'"", {
              ""include_dirs"": [ ""<(node_root_dir)/deps/openssl/config/arm"" ]
            }]
          ]
        }]
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This ensures that when OpenSSL is statically linked into `node` then, the bundled OpenSSL headers are included, but when the system OpenSSL is in use, then only those headers will be used


## Windows?

As you can see this baseline `binding
gyp` file only accounts for the Unix scenario
 Currently on Windows the situation is a little less ideal
 On Windows, OpenSSL is _always_ statically compiled into the `node` executable, so ideally it would be possible to use that copy of OpenSSL when building native addons


Unfortunately it doesn't seem like that is possible at the moment, as there would need to be tweaks made to the generated `node
lib` file to include the openssl glue functions, or a new `openssl
lib` file would need to be created during the node build
 I'm not sure which is the easiest/most feasible


In the meantime, one possible solution is using another copy of OpenSSL, which is what [`node-bcrypt`](https://github
com/ncb000gt/node
bcrypt
js) currently does
 Adding something like this to your `binding
gyp` file's `""conditions""` block would enable this:

``` python
    [ 'OS==""win""', {
      'conditions': [
        # ""openssl_root"" is the directory on Windows of the OpenSSL files

        # Check the ""target_arch"" variable to set good default values for
        # both 64-bit and 32-bit builds of the module

        ['target_arch==""x64""', {
          'variables': {
            'openssl_root%': 'C:/OpenSSL-Win64'
          },
        }, {
          'variables': {
            'openssl_root%': 'C:/OpenSSL-Win32'
          },
        }],
      ],
      'libraries': [ 
        '-l<(openssl_root)/lib/libeay32
lib',
      ],
      'include_dirs': [
        '<(openssl_root)/include',
      ],
    }]
```

Now you can direct your users to install OpenSSL on Windows from here (be sure to tell them to install the 64-bit version if they're compiling against a 64-bit version of node): http://slproweb
com/products/Win32OpenSSL
html

Also note that both `node-gyp` and `npm` allow you to overwrite that default `openssl_root` variable on the command line:

``` bash
$ node-gyp rebuild --openssl-root=""C:\Users\Nathan\Desktop\openssl""
```
## Versions of `node-gyp` that are earlier than v9
x

Please look thru your error log for the string `gyp info using node-gyp@` and if that version number is less than the [current release of node-gyp](https://github
com/nodejs/node-gyp/releases) then __please upgrade__ using [these instructions](https://github
com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/master/docs/Updating-npm-bundled-node-gyp
md) and then try your command again


## `node-sass` is deprecated

Please be aware that the package [`node-sass` is deprecated](https://github
com/sass/node-sass#node-sass) so you should actively seek alternatives
  You can try:
```
npm uninstall node-sass
npm install sass --save
# or 



npm install --global node-sass@latest
```
`node-sass` projects _may_ work by downgrading to Node
js v14 but [that release is end-of-life](https://github
com/nodejs/release#release-schedule)

But in any case, please avoid opening new `node-sass` issues on this repo because we [cannot help much](https://github
com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Node+Sass+--%3E+Dart+Sass%22+)


## Issues finding the installed Visual Studio

In cmd, [`npm config set msvs_version 20xx`](https://github
com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-windows) with ___xx___ matching your locally installed version of Visual Studio


# Updating the npm-bundled version of node-gyp

**Note: These instructions are (only) tested and known to work with npm 8 and older
**

**Note: These instructions will be undone if you reinstall or upgrade npm or node! For a more permanent (and simpler) solution, see [Force-npm-to-use-global-node-gyp
md](Force-npm-to-use-global-node-gyp
md)
 (npm 6 or older only!)**

[Many issues](https://github
com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues?q=label%3A""ERR!+node-gyp+-v+<%3D+v9
com/nodejs/node-gyp/releases)


`npm` bundles its own, internal, copy of `node-gyp`
 This internal copy is independent of any globally installed copy of node-gyp that
may have been installed via `npm install -g node-gyp`


This means that while `node-gyp` doesn't get installed into your `$PATH` by default, npm still keeps its own copy to invoke when you
attempt to `npm install` a native add-on


Sometimes, you may need to update npm's internal node-gyp to a newer version than what is installed
 A simple `npm install -g node-gyp`
_won't_ do the trick since npm will still continue to use its internal copy over the global one


So instead:

## Version of npm

We need to start by knowing your version of `npm`:
```bash
npm --version
```

## Linux, macOS, Solaris, etc


Unix is easy
 Just run the following command


If your npm is version ___7 or 8___, do:
```bash
$ npm explore npm/node_modules/@npmcli/run-script -g -- npm_config_global=false npm install node-gyp@latest
```

Else if your npm is version ___less than 7___, do:
```bash
$ npm explore npm/node_modules/npm-lifecycle -g -- npm install node-gyp@latest
```

If the command fails with a permissions error, please try `sudo` and then the command


## Windows

Windows is a bit trickier, since `npm` might be installed to the ""Program Files"" directory, which needs admin privileges in order to
modify on current Windows
 Therefore, run the following commands __inside a `cmd
exe` started with ""Run as Administrator""__:

First we need to find the location of `node`
 If you don't already know the location that `node
exe` got installed to, then run:
```bash
$ where node
```

Now `cd` to the directory that `node
exe` is contained in e
g
:
```bash
$ cd ""C:\Program Files\nodejs""
```

If your npm version is ___7 or 8___, do:
```bash
cd node_modules\npm\node_modules\@npmcli\run-script
```

Else if your npm version is ___less than 7___, do:
```bash
cd node_modules\npm\node_modules\npm-lifecycle
```

Finish by running:
```bash
$ npm install node-gyp@latest
```

# Dealing with Browser-Extension Exceptions

For most websites, the path for dealing with browser extension originating exceptions is simply to:

1
  Identify the presence of problematic browser extensions
2
  Disable Rollbar
js's reporting

## Dealing with adblockers

The most common type of extension that can be problematic is adblockers
  These extensions can disable loading
certain external scripts or remove elements from a page based on a simple set of heuristics


You can see a [full example](https://github
com/rollbar/rollbar
js/tree/master/examples/extension-exceptions/)
for details, but the approach can best summarized as below:

Load Rollbar


```html
<script src=""/assets/js/rollbar
js""></script>

<script>
  var _rollbarConfig = {
    accessToken: 'POST_CLIENT_ITEM_ACCESS_TOKEN',
    captureUncaught: true,
    payload: {
      environment: 'development',
    }
  };
</script>
```

Add an html element with ""bait"" class names to be removed by adblockers


```html
<!-- bait for adblocker like addons
  If they remove this div, we should disable error reporting -->
<div id=""blocker-bait"" style=""height: 1px; width: 1px; position: absolute; left: -999em; top: -999em""
     class=""ads ad adsbox doubleclick ad-placement carbon-ads""></div>
```

Add functions to check for the presence and visibility of our bait div
configure({enabled: false});
  }

  function checkForAds() {
    var bait = document
getElementById(""blocker-bait"");

    if (bait == null) {
      disableRollbar();
      return;
    }

    var baitStyles = window
getComputedStyle(bait);
    if (baitStyles && (
        baitStyles
getPropertyValue('display') === 'none' ||
        baitStyles
getPropertyValue('visibility') === 'hidden')) {
      disableRollbar();
    }
  }

  function onLoadStartAdCheck() {
    // Ad blockers generally execute just after load, let's delay ourselves to get behind it

    setTimeout(checkForAds, 1);
  }

  if (window
addEventListener !== undefined) {
    window
addEventListener('load', onLoadStartAdCheck, false);
  } else {
    window
attachEvent('onload', onLoadStartAdCheck);
  }
```

The above approach is likely to work in the majority of cases, *but it is not foolproof*
  Extensions and their
behavior evolve over time and nothing stops a user from opening their console and modifying / executing code as well

A practical approach involves incrementally adjusting your detection as new exceptions occur in large numbers


# Migrating from the v0
XX notifier to v1
XX

<!-- Sub:[TOC] -->

## Update your snippet

### Change the config object:

```js
var _rollbarParams = {""server
environment"": ""production""};
_rollbarParams[""notifier
snippet_version""] = ""2""; var _rollbar=[""POST_CLIENT_ITEM_ACCESS_TOKEN"", _rollbarParams];
```

to 

```js
var _rollbarConfig = {
  accessToken: ""POST_CLIENT_ITEM_ACCESS_TOKEN"",
  captureUncaught: true,
  payload: {
    environment: ""production""
  }
};
```

If you have any extra config options in `_rollbarParams` you'll need to add them to `_rollbarConfig`


e
g


```js
var _rollbarParams = {
  checkIgnore: function(msg, url, lineNo, colNo, error) {
    // don't ignore anything (default)
    return false;
  },
  context: ""home#index"",
  itemsPerMinute: 60,
  level: ""error"",
  person: {
    id: 12345,
    username: ""johndoe"",
    email: ""johndoe@example
com""
  },
  ""server
branch"": ""develop"",
  ""server
environment"": ""staging"",
  ""server
host"": ""web1""
};
```

should be changed to

```js
var _rollbarConfig = {
  accessToken: ""POST_CLIENT_ITEM_ACCESS_TOKEN"",
  captureUncaught: true,
  checkIgnore: function(msg, url, lineNo, colNo, error) {
    // don't ignore anything (default)
    return false;
  },
  itemsPerMinute: 60,
  logLevel: ""error"",
  payload: {
    environment: ""production"",
    context: ""home#index"",
    person: {
      id: 12345,
      username: ""johndoe"",
      email: ""johndoe@example
com""
    },
    server: {
      branch: ""develop"",
      environment: ""staging"",
      host: ""web1""
    }
  }
};
```

### Change the snippet

For the latest snippet, see the instructions here: [https://rollbar
com/docs/notifier/rollbar
js/](https://rollbar
com/docs/notifier/rollbar
js/)



## Update references to `_rollbar
push()`

The v1 notifier has a more intuitive interface for recording errors and generic logging


### Recording a caught exception

From

```js
try {
  doSomething();
} catch (e) {
  _rollbar
push(e);
}
```

to

```js
try {
  doSomething();
} catch (e) {
  // Note: You can also use Rollbar
warning(e) to report the exception as a ""warning"" to Rollbar

  // Other options:
  //   Rollbar
debug(e) - report as ""debug""
  //   Rollbar
info(e)
  //   Rollbar
warning(e)
  //   Rollbar
error(e)
  //   Rollbar
critical(e)
  //   Rollbar
log(e) - reports as whatever ""logLevel"" confiugration option was used in the snippet

  Rollbar
log(e);

  // Note: You can also include a custom message and custom data along with the exception
  // Rollbar
log(""Caught an error while doing something
"", e, {somevar: ""someval""});
}
```


### Recording a log message

From

```js
_rollbar
push(""Some log message"");
```

to

```js
Rollbar
info(""Some log message"");
```

#### Including custom data

From

```js
_rollbar
push({level: ""warning"", msg: ""Some warning message"", point: {x: 5, y: 10}});
```

to

```js
Rollbar
warning(""Some warning message"", {point: {x: 5, y: 10}});
```

#### Using callbacks

From

```js
try {
  doSomething();
} catch (e) {
  _rollbar
push(e, function(err, uuid) {
    if (err !== null) {
      console
error(""Could not report an exception to Rollbar, error: "" + err);
    } else {
      console
log(""Reported exception to Rollbar, uuid: "" + uuid);
    }
  });
}
```

to

```js
try {
  doSomething();
} catch (e) {
  Rollbar
error(""Could not report an exception to Rollbar, error: "" + err);
    } else {
      console
log(""Reported exception to Rollbar, uuid: "" + uuid);
    }
  });
}
```

## Update the jQuery plugin

See the [jQuery plugin docs](https://rollbar
com/docs/notifier/rollbar
js/plugins)


## Using in embedded browsers or extensions

Similar to the v0 instructions, be sure to use ""https"" instead of a protocol-less URL in the snippet

 Read more on the v4 docs

* rewind(), skip(), moveTo() have been removed

* Internal private properties are now prefixed with underscores (_)

* **All** writeXXX() methods that are given an offset will now **overwrite data** instead of insert

smart-buffer is a light Buffer wrapper that takes away the need to keep track of what position to read and write data to and from the underlying Buffer
 It also adds null terminating string operations and **grows** as you add more data


![stats](https://nodei
co/npm/smart-buffer
png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true ""stats"")

### What it's useful for:

I created smart-buffer because I wanted to simplify the process of using Buffer for building and reading network packets to send over a socket
 Rather than having to keep track of which position I need to write a UInt16 to after adding a string of variable length, I simply don't have to


Key Features:
* Proxies all of the Buffer write and read functions

* Keeps track of read and write positions for you

* Grows the internal Buffer as you add data to it
 
* Useful string operations
 (Null terminating strings)
* Allows for inserting values at specific points in the internal Buffer

* Built in TypeScript
* Type Definitions Provided

Requirements:
* Node v4
0+ is supported at this time
  (Versions prior to 2
0 will work on node 0
10)


#### Note:
smart-buffer can be used for writing to an underlying buffer as well as reading from it
 It however does not function correctly if you're mixing both read and write operations with each other


## Breaking Changes with 2
0
The latest version (2
0+) is written in TypeScript, and are compiled to ES6 Javascript
 This means the earliest Node
js it supports will be 4
x (in strict mode
) If you're using version 6 and above it will work without any issues
 From an API standpoint, 2
0 is backwards compatible
 The only difference is SmartBuffer is not exported directly as the root module


## Breaking Changes with 3
0
Starting with 3
0, if any of the readIntXXXX() methods are called and the requested data is larger than the bounds of the internally managed valid buffer data, an exception will now be thrown


## Installing:

`npm install smart-buffer`

or

`yarn add smart-buffer`

Note: The published NPM package includes the built javascript library
 
If you cloned this repo and wish to build the library manually use:

`tsc -p 
/`

## Using smart-buffer

### Example

Say you were building a packet that had to conform to the following protocol:

`[PacketType:2][PacketLength:2][Data:XX]`

To build this packet using the vanilla Buffer class, you would have to count up the length of the data payload beforehand
 You would also need to keep track of the current ""cursor"" position in your Buffer so you write everything in the right places
 With smart-buffer you don't have to do either of those things


```javascript
// 1
x (javascript)
var SmartBuffer = require('smart-buffer');

// 1
x (typescript)
import SmartBuffer = require('smart-buffer');

// 2
x+ (javascript)
const SmartBuffer = require('smart-buffer')
SmartBuffer;

// 2
x+ (typescript)
import { SmartBuffer, SmartBufferOptions} from 'smart-buffer';

function createLoginPacket(username, password, age, country) {
    let packet = new SmartBuffer();
    packet
writeUInt16LE(0x0060); // Login Packet Type/ID
    packet
writeStringNT(username);
    packet
writeStringNT(password);
    packet
writeUInt8(age);
    packet
writeStringNT(country);
    packet
writeUInt16LE(packet
length - 2, 2);
    
    return packet
toBuffer();
}
```
With the above function, you now can do this:
```javascript
let login = createLoginPacket(""Josh"", ""secret123"", 22, ""United States"");

// <Buffer 60 00 1e 00 4a 6f 73 68 00 73 65 63 72 65 74 31 32 33 00 16 55 6e 69 74 65 64 20 53 74 61 74 65 73 00>
```
Notice that the `[PacketLength:2]` part of the packet was inserted after we had added everything else, and as shown in the Buffer dump above, is in the correct location along with everything else


Reading back the packet we created above is just as easy:
```javascript

let reader = SmartBuffer
fromBuffer(login);

let logininfo = {
    packetType: reader
readUInt16LE(),
    packetLength: reader
readUInt16LE(),
    username: reader
readStringNT(),
    password: reader
readStringNT(),
    age: reader
readUInt8(),
    country: reader
readStringNT()
};

/*
{ 
    packetType: 96, (0x0060)
    packetLength: 30,
    username: 'Josh',
    password: 'secret123',
    age: 22,
    country: 'United States' 
};
*/
```

# Api Reference:

### Constructing a smart-buffer

smart-buffer has a few different ways to construct an instance
 Starting with version 2
0, the following factory methods are preffered


```javascript
let SmartBuffer = require('smart-buffer');

// Creating SmartBuffer from existing Buffer
let buff = SmartBuffer
fromBuffer(buffer); // Creates instance from buffer
 (Uses default utf8 encoding)
let buff = SmartBuffer
fromBuffer(buffer, 'ascii'); // Creates instance from buffer with ascii encoding for Strings
 

// Creating SmartBuffer with specified internal Buffer size

let buff = SmartBuffer
fromSize(1024); // Creates instance with internal Buffer size of 1024

let buff = SmartBuffer
fromSize(1024, 'utf8'); // Creates instance with intenral Buffer size of 1024, and utf8 encoding
 

// Creating SmartBuffer with options object
 This one specifies size and encoding

let buff = SmartBuffer
fromOptions({
    size: 1024,
    encoding: 'ascii'
});

// Creating SmartBuffer with options object
 This one specified an existing Buffer

let buff = SmartBuffer
fromOptions({
    buff: buffer
});

// Just want a regular SmartBuffer with all default options?
let buff = new SmartBuffer();
```

## Backwards Compatibility:

All constructors used prior to 2
0 still are supported


```javascript
let writer = new SmartBuffer();               // Defaults to utf8, 4096 length internal Buffer

let writer = new SmartBuffer(1024);           // Defaults to utf8, 1024 length internal Buffer

let writer = new SmartBuffer('ascii');         // Sets to ascii encoding, 4096 length internal buffer

let writer = new SmartBuffer(1024, 'ascii');  // Sets to ascii encoding, 1024 length internal buffer

```

## Reading Data

smart-buffer supports all of the common read functions you will find in the vanilla Buffer class
 The only difference is, you do not need to specify which location to start reading from
 This is possible because as you read data out of a smart-buffer, it automatically progresses an internal read offset/position to know where to pick up from on the next read


## Reading Numeric Values

When numeric values, you simply need to call the function you want, and the data is returned


Supported Operations:
* readInt8
* readInt16BE
* readInt16LE
* readInt32BE
* readInt32LE
* readBigInt64LE
* readBigInt64BE
* readUInt8
* readUInt16BE
* readUInt16LE
* readUInt32BE
* readUInt32LE
* readBigUInt64LE
* readBigUInt64BE
* readFloatBE
* readFloatLE
* readDoubleBE
* readDoubleLE

```javascript
let reader = new SmartBuffer(somebuffer);
let num = reader
readInt8();
```

## Reading String Values

When reading String values, you can either choose to read a null terminated string, or a string of a specified length


### SmartBuffer
readStringNT( [encoding] )
> `String` **String encoding to use**  - Defaults to the encoding set in the constructor
 

returns `String`

> Note: When readStringNT is called and there is no null character found, smart-buffer will read to the end of the internal Buffer


### SmartBuffer
readString( [length] )
### SmartBuffer
readString( [encoding] )
### SmartBuffer
readString( [length], [encoding] )
> `Number` **Length of the string to read**

> `String` **String encoding to use** - Defaults to the encoding set in the constructor, or utf8


returns `String`

> Note: When readString is called without a specified length, smart-buffer will read to the end of the internal Buffer




## Reading Buffer Values

### SmartBuffer
readBuffer( length )
> `Number` **Length of data to read into a Buffer**

returns `Buffer`

> Note: This function uses `slice` to retrieve the Buffer



### SmartBuffer
readBufferNT()

returns `Buffer`

> Note: This reads the next sequence of bytes in the buffer until a null (0x00) value is found
 (Null terminated buffer)
> Note: This function uses `slice` to retrieve the Buffer



## Writing Data

smart-buffer supports all of the common write functions you will find in the vanilla Buffer class
 The only difference is, you do not need to specify which location to write to in your Buffer by default
 You do however have the option of **inserting** a piece of data into your smart-buffer at a given location
 


## Writing Numeric Values


For numeric values, you simply need to call the function you want, and the data is written at the end of the internal Buffer's current write position
 You can specify a offset/position to **insert** the given value at, but keep in mind this does not override data at the given position
 This feature also does not work properly when inserting a value beyond the current internal length of the smart-buffer (length being the 
length property of the smart-buffer instance you're writing to)

Supported Operations:
* writeInt8
* writeInt16BE
* writeInt16LE
* writeInt32BE
* writeInt32LE
* writeBigInt64BE
* writeBigInt64LE
* writeUInt8
* writeUInt16BE
* writeUInt16LE
* writeUInt32BE
* writeUInt32LE
* writeBigUInt64BE
* writeBigUInt64LE
* writeFloatBE
* writeFloatLE
* writeDoubleBE
* writeDoubleLE

The following signature is the same for all the above functions:

### SmartBuffer
writeInt8( value, [offset] )
> `Number` **A valid Int8 number**

> `Number` **The position to insert this value at** 

returns this 

> Note: All write operations return `this` to allow for chaining


## Writing String Values

When reading String values, you can either choose to write a null terminated string, or a non null terminated string


### SmartBuffer
writeStringNT( value, [offset], [encoding] )
### SmartBuffer
writeStringNT( value, [offset] )
### SmartBuffer
writeStringNT( value, [encoding] )
> `String` **String value to write**

> `Number` **The position to insert this String at**

> `String` **The String encoding to use
** - Defaults to the encoding set in the constructor, or utf8


returns this

### SmartBuffer
writeString( value, [offset], [encoding] )
### SmartBuffer
writeString( value, [offset] )
### SmartBuffer
writeString( value, [encoding] )
> `String` **String value to write**

> `Number` **The position to insert this String at**

> `String` **The String encoding to use** - Defaults to the encoding set in the constructor, or utf8


returns this


## Writing Buffer Values

### SmartBuffer
writeBuffer( value, [offset] )
> `Buffer` **Buffer value to write**

> `Number` **The position to insert this Buffer's content at**

returns this

### SmartBuffer
writeBufferNT( value, [offset] )
> `Buffer` **Buffer value to write**

> `Number` **The position to insert this Buffer's content at**

returns this


## Utility Functions

### SmartBuffer
clear()
Resets the SmartBuffer to its default state where it can be reused for reading or writing


### SmartBuffer
remaining()

returns `Number` The amount of data left to read based on the current read Position


### SmartBuffer
skip( value )
> `Number` **The amount of bytes to skip ahead**

Skips the read position ahead by the given value


returns this

### SmartBuffer
rewind( value )
> `Number` **The amount of bytes to reward backwards**

Rewinds the read position backwards by the given value


returns this

### SmartBuffer
moveTo( position )
> `Number` **The point to skip the read position to**

Moves the read position to the given point

returns this

### SmartBuffer
toBuffer()

returns `Buffer` A Buffer containing the contents of the internal Buffer


> Note: This uses the slice function


### SmartBuffer
toString( [encoding] )
> `String` **The String encoding to use** - Defaults to the encoding set in the constructor, or utf8


returns `String` The internal Buffer in String representation


## Properties

### SmartBuffer
length

returns `Number` **The length of the data that is being tracked in the internal Buffer** - Does NOT return the absolute length of the internal Buffer being written to

## Example for SOCKS 'associate' command

The associate command tells the SOCKS proxy server to establish a UDP relay
 The server binds to a new UDP port and communicates the newly opened port back to the origin client
 From here, any SOCKS UDP frame packets sent to this special UDP port on the Proxy server will be forwarded to the desired destination, and any responses will be forwarded back to the origin client (you)


This can be used for things such as DNS queries, and other UDP communicates


**Connection Steps**

1
 Client -(associate)-> Proxy (Tells the proxy to create a UDP relay and bind on a new port)
2
 Client <-(port)- Proxy (Tells the origin client which port it opened and is accepting UDP frame packets on)

At this point the proxy is accepting UDP frames on the specified port


3
 Client --(udp frame) -> Proxy -> Destination (The origin client sends a UDP frame to the proxy on the UDP port, and the proxy then forwards it to the destination specified in the UDP frame
)
4
 Client <--(udp frame) <-- Proxy <-- Destination (The destination client responds to the udp packet sent in #3)

## Usage

The 'associate' command can only be used by creating a new SocksClient instance and listening for the 'established' event


**Note:** UDP packets relayed through the proxy servers are encompassed in a special Socks UDP frame format
 SocksClient
createUDPFrame() and SocksClient
parseUDPFrame() create and parse these special UDP packets


```typescript
const dgram = require('dgram');
const SocksClient = require('socks')
SocksClient;

// Create a local UDP socket for sending/receiving packets to/from the proxy

const udpSocket = dgram
createSocket('udp4');
udpSocket
bind();

// Listen for incoming UDP packets from the proxy server

udpSocket
on('message', (message, rinfo) => {
  console
log(SocksClient
parseUDPFrame(message));
  /*
  { frameNumber: 0,
    remoteHost: { host: '8
8
8
8', port: 53 }, // The remote host that replied with a UDP packet
    data: <Buffer 74 65 73 74 0a> // The data
  }
  */
});

const options = {
  proxy: {
    host: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  // This should be the ip and port of the expected client that will be sending UDP frames to the newly opened UDP port on the server

  // Most SOCKS servers accept 0
0
0
0 as a wildcard address to accept UDP frames from any source

  destination: {
    host: '0
0
0
0',
    port: 0
  },

  command: 'associate'
};

const client = new SocksClient(options);

// This event is fired when the SOCKS server has started listening on a new UDP port for UDP relaying

client
on('established', info => {
  console


>,
    remoteHost: { // This is the remote port on the SOCKS proxy server to send UDP frame packets to

      host: '104
131
124
203',
      port: 58232
    }
  }
  */

  // Send a udp frame to 8
8
8
8 on port 53 through the proxy

  const packet = SocksClient
createUDPFrame({
    remoteHost: { host: '8
8
8
8', port: 53 },
    data: Buffer
from('hello') // A DNS lookup in the real world

  });

  // Send packet

  udpSocket
send(packet, info
remoteHost
port, info
remoteHost
host);
});

// SOCKS proxy failed to bind

client
on('error', () => {
  // Handle errors
});
```

# socks examples

## Example for SOCKS 'bind' command

The bind command tells the SOCKS proxy server to bind and listen on a new TCP port for an incoming connection
 It communicates the newly opened port back to the origin client
 Once a incoming connection is accepted by the SOCKS proxy server it then communicates the remote host that connected to the SOCKS proxy back through the same initial connection via the origin client


This can be used for things such as FTP clients which require incoming TCP connections, etc


**Connection Steps**

1
 Client -(bind)-> Proxy    (Tells the proxy to bind to a new port)
2
 Client <-(port)- Proxy    (Tells the origin client which port it opened)
3
 Client2 --> Proxy    (Other client connects to the proxy on this port)
4
 Client <--(client2's host info)  (Proxy tells the origin client who connected to it)
5
 Original connection to the proxy is now a full TCP stream between client (you) and client2

6
 Client <--> Proxy <--> Client2


## Usage

The 'bind' command can only be used by creating a new SocksClient instance and listening for 'bound' and 'established' events



```typescript
const SocksClient = require('socks')
SocksClient;

const options = {
  proxy: {
    host: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  // This should be the ip and port of the expected client that will connect to the SOCKS proxy server on the newly bound port

  // Most SOCKS servers accept 0
0
0
0 as a wildcard address to accept any client

  destination: {
    host: '0
0
0
0',
    port: 0
  },

  command: 'bind'
};

const client = new SocksClient(options);

// This event is fired when the SOCKS server has started listening on a new port for incoming connections

client
on('bound', (info) => {
  console


>,
    remoteHost: { // This is the remote ip and port of the SOCKS proxy that is now accepting incoming connections

      host: '104
131
124
203',
      port: 49928
    }
  }
  */
});

// This event is fired when the SOCKS server has accepted an incoming connection on the newly bound port

client
on('established', (info) => {
  console


>,
    remoteHost: { // This is the remote ip and port that connected to the SOCKS proxy on the newly bound port

      host: '1
2
3
4',
      port: 58232
    }
  }
  */

  // At this point info
socket is a regular net
Socket TCP connection between client and client2 (1
2
3
4) (the client which connected to the proxy on the newly bound port
)

  console
socket);
  // <Socket 


>  (this is a raw net
Socket that is established to the destination host through the given proxy servers)
});

// SOCKS proxy failed to bind

client
on('error', () => {
  // Handle errors
});
```
# socks examples

## Example for SOCKS 'connect' command

The connect command is the most common use-case for a SOCKS proxy
 This establishes a direct connection to a destination host through a proxy server
 The destination host only has knowledge of the proxy server connecting to it and does not know about the origin client (you)


**Origin Client (you) <-> Proxy Server <-> Destination Server**

In this example, we are connecting to a web server on port 80, and sending a very basic HTTP request to receive a response
 It's worth noting that there are many socks-http-agents that can be used with the node http module (and libraries such as request
js) to make this easier
 This HTTP request is used as a simple example


The 'connect' command can be used via the SocksClient
createConnection() factory function as well as by creating a SocksClient instance and using event handlers


### Using createConnection with async/await

Since SocksClient
createConnection returns a Promise, we can easily use async/await for flow control


```typescript
const SocksClient = require('socks')
SocksClient;

const options  = {
  proxy: {
    host: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  destination: {
    host: 'ip-api
com', // host names are supported with SOCKS v4a and SOCKS v5

    port: 80
  },

  command: 'connect'
};

async function start() {
  try {
    const info = await SocksClient
createConnection(options);

    console
socket);
    // <Socket 


>  (this is a raw net
Socket that is established to the destination host through the given proxy servers)

    info
socket
write('GET /json HTTP/1
1\nHost: ip-api
com\n\n');
    info
socket
on('data', (data) => {
      console
log(data
toString()); // ip-api
com sees that the last proxy (104
131
124
203) is connected to it and not the origin client (you)

### Using createConnection with Promises

```typescript
const SocksClient = require('socks')
SocksClient;

const options  = {
  proxy: {
    ipaddress: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,

})

catch(err => {
  // handle errors
});
```

### Using createConnection with callbacks

SocksClient
createConnection() optionally accepts a callback function as a second parameter


**Note:** If a callback function is provided, a Promise is still returned from the function, but the promise will always resolve regardless of if there was en error
 (tldr: Do not mix callbacks and Promises)


```typescript
const SocksClient = require('socks')
SocksClient;

const options  = {
  proxy: {
    ipaddress: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  destination: {
    host: 'ip-api
com', // host names are supported with SOCKS v4a and SOCKS v5

    port: 80
  },

  command: 'connect'
};

SocksClient
socket);
    // <Socket 


>  (this is a raw net
Socket that is established to the destination host through the given proxy servers)

    info
socket
write('GET /json HTTP/1
1\nHost: ip-api
com\n\n');
    info
socket
on('data', (data) => {
      console
log(data
toString()); // ip-api
com sees that the last proxy (104
131
124
203) is connected to it and not the origin client (you)

      /*

### Using event handlers

SocksClient also supports instance creation of a SocksClient
 This allows for event based flow control


```typescript
const SocksClient = require('socks')
SocksClient;

const options  = {
  proxy: {
    ipaddress: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  destination: {
    host: 'ip-api
com', // host names are supported with SOCKS v4a and SOCKS v5

    port: 80
  },

  command: 'connect'
};

const client = new SocksClient(options);

client
on('established', (info) => {
  console
socket);
  // <Socket 


>  (this is a raw net
Socket that is established to the destination host through the given proxy servers)

  info
socket
write('GET /json HTTP/1
1\nHost: ip-api
com\n\n');
  info
socket
on('data', (data) => {
    console
log(data
toString()); // ip-api
com sees that the last proxy (104
131
124
203) is connected to it and not the origin client (you)

## Example for SOCKS 'associate' command

The associate command tells the SOCKS proxy server to establish a UDP relay
 The server binds to a new UDP port and communicates the newly opened port back to the origin client
 From here, any SOCKS UDP frame packets sent to this special UDP port on the Proxy server will be forwarded to the desired destination, and any responses will be forwarded back to the origin client (you)


This can be used for things such as DNS queries, and other UDP communicates


**Connection Steps**

1
 Client -(associate)-> Proxy (Tells the proxy to create a UDP relay and bind on a new port)
2
 Client <-(port)- Proxy (Tells the origin client which port it opened and is accepting UDP frame packets on)

At this point the proxy is accepting UDP frames on the specified port


3
 Client --(udp frame) -> Proxy -> Destination (The origin client sends a UDP frame to the proxy on the UDP port, and the proxy then forwards it to the destination specified in the UDP frame
)
4
 Client <--(udp frame) <-- Proxy <-- Destination (The destination client responds to the udp packet sent in #3)

## Usage

The 'associate' command can only be used by creating a new SocksClient instance and listening for the 'established' event


**Note:** UDP packets relayed through the proxy servers are packaged in a special Socks UDP frame format
 SocksClient
createUDPFrame() and SocksClient
parseUDPFrame() create and parse these special UDP packets


```typescript
import * as dgram from 'dgram';
import { SocksClient, SocksClientOptions } from 'socks';

// Create a local UDP socket for sending/receiving packets to/from the proxy

const udpSocket = dgram
createSocket('udp4');
udpSocket
bind();

// Listen for incoming UDP packets from the proxy server

udpSocket
on('message', (message, rinfo) => {
  console
log(SocksClient
parseUDPFrame(message));
  /*
  { frameNumber: 0,
    remoteHost: { host: '8
8
8
8', port: 53 }, // The remote host that replied with a UDP packet
    data: <Buffer 74 65 73 74 0a> // The data
  }
  */
});

const options: SocksClientOptions = {
  proxy: {
    host: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  // This should be the ip and port of the expected client that will be sending UDP frames to the newly opened UDP port on the server

  // Most SOCKS servers accept 0
0
0
0 as a wildcard address to accept UDP frames from any source

  destination: {
    host: '0
0
0
0',
    port: 0
  },

  command: 'associate'
};

const client = new SocksClient(options);

// This event is fired when the SOCKS server has started listening on a new UDP port for UDP relaying

client
on('established', info => {
  console


>,
    remoteHost: { // This is the remote port on the SOCKS proxy server to send UDP frame packets to

      host: '104
131
124
203',
      port: 58232
    }
  }
  */

  // Send a udp frame to 8
8
8
8 on port 53 through the proxy

  const packet = SocksClient
createUDPFrame({
    remoteHost: { host: '8
8
8
8', port: 53 },
    data: Buffer
from('hello') // A DNS lookup in the real world

  });

  // Send packet

  udpSocket
send(packet, info
remoteHost
port, info
remoteHost
host);
});

// SOCKS proxy failed to bind

client
on('error', () => {
  // Handle errors
});

// Start connection
client
connect();
```

# socks examples

## Example for SOCKS 'bind' command

The bind command tells the SOCKS proxy server to bind and listen on a new TCP port for an incoming connection
 It communicates the newly opened port back to the origin client
 Once a incoming connection is accepted by the SOCKS proxy server it then communicates the remote host that connected to the SOCKS proxy back through the same initial connection via the origin client


This can be used for things such as FTP clients which require incoming TCP connections, etc


**Connection Steps**

1
 Client -(bind)-> Proxy    (Tells the proxy to bind to a new port)
2
 Client <-(port)- Proxy    (Tells the origin client which port it opened)
3
 Client2 --> Proxy    (Other client connects to the proxy on this port)
4
 Client <--(client2's host info)  (Proxy tells the origin client who connected to it)
5
 Original connection to the proxy is now a full TCP stream between client (you) and client2

6
 Client <--> Proxy <--> Client2


## Usage

The 'bind' command can only be used by creating a new SocksClient instance and listening for 'bound' and 'established' events



```typescript
import { SocksClient, SocksClientOptions } from 'socks';

const options: SocksClientOptions = {
  proxy: {
    host: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  // This should be the ip and port of the expected client that will connect to the SOCKS proxy server on the newly bound port

  // Most SOCKS servers accept 0
0
0
0 as a wildcard address to accept any client

  destination: {
    host: '0
0
0
0',
    port: 0
  },

  command: 'bind'
};

const client = new SocksClient(options);

// This event is fired when the SOCKS server has started listening on a new port for incoming connections

client
on('bound', (info) => {
  console


>,
    remoteHost: { // This is the remote ip and port of the SOCKS proxy that is now accepting incoming connections

      host: '104
131
124
203',
      port: 49928
    }
  }
  */
});

// This event is fired when the SOCKS server has accepted an incoming connection on the newly bound port

client
on('established', (info) => {
  console


>,
    remoteHost: { // This is the remote ip and port that connected to the SOCKS proxy on the newly bound port

      host: '1
2
3
4',
      port: 58232
    }
  }
  */

  // At this point info
socket is a regular net
Socket TCP connection between client and client2 (1
2
3
4) (the client which connected to the proxy on the newly bound port
)

  console
socket);
  // <Socket 


>  (this is a raw net
Socket that is established to the destination host through the given proxy servers)
});

// SOCKS proxy failed to bind

client
on('error', () => {
  // Handle errors
});

// Start connection
client
connect();
```
# socks examples

## Example for SOCKS 'connect' command

The connect command is the most common use-case for a SOCKS proxy
 This establishes a direct connection to a destination host through a proxy server
 The destination host only has knowledge of the proxy server connecting to it and does not know about the origin client (you)


**Origin Client (you) <-> Proxy Server <-> Destination Server**

In this example, we are connecting to a web server on port 80, and sending a very basic HTTP request to receive a response
 It's worth noting that there are many socks-http-agents that can be used with the node http module (and libraries such as request
js) to make this easier
 This HTTP request is used as a simple example


The 'connect' command can be used via the SocksClient
createConnection() factory function as well as by creating a SocksClient instance and using event handlers


### Using createConnection with async/await

Since SocksClient
createConnection returns a Promise, we can easily use async/await for flow control


```typescript
import { SocksClient, SocksClientOptions } from 'socks';

const options: SocksClientOptions = {
  proxy: {
    host: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  destination: {
    host: 'ip-api
com', // host names are supported with SOCKS v4a and SOCKS v5

    port: 80
  },

  command: 'connect'
};

async function start() {
  try {
    const info = await SocksClient
createConnection(options);

    console
socket);
    // <Socket 


>  (this is a raw net
Socket that is established to the destination host through the given proxy servers)

    info
socket
write('GET /json HTTP/1
1\nHost: ip-api
com\n\n');
    info
socket
on('data', (data) => {
      console
log(data
toString()); // ip-api
com sees that the last proxy (104
131
124
203) is connected to it and not the origin client (you)

### Using createConnection with Promises

```typescript
import { SocksClient, SocksClientOptions } from 'socks';

const options: SocksClientOptions = {
  proxy: {
    ipaddress: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  destination: {
    host: 'ip-api
com', // host names are supported with SOCKS v4a and SOCKS v5

    port: 80
  },

  command: 'connect'
};

SocksClient
createConnection(options)

then(info => {

  });
})

catch(err => {
  // handle errors
});
```

### Using createConnection with callbacks

SocksClient
createConnection() optionally accepts a callback function as a second parameter


**Note:** If a callback function is provided, a Promise is still returned from the function, but the promise will always resolve regardless of if there was en error
 (tldr: Do not mix callbacks and Promises)


```typescript
import { SocksClient, SocksClientOptions } from 'socks';

const options: SocksClientOptions = {
  proxy: {
    ipaddress: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  destination: {
    host: 'ip-api
com', // host names are supported with SOCKS v4a and SOCKS v5

    port: 80
  },

  command: 'connect'
};

SocksClient
socket);
    // <Socket 


>  (this is a raw net
Socket that is established to the destination host through the given proxy servers)

    info
socket
write('GET /json HTTP/1
1\nHost: ip-api
com\n\n');
    info
socket
on('data', (data) => {
      console
log(data
toString()); // ip-api
com sees that the last proxy (104
131
124
203) is connected to it and not the origin client (you)

      /*
        HTTP/1
1 200 OK
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
        Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
        Date: Sun, 24 Dec 2017 03:47:51 GMT
        Content-Length: 300

        {
          ""as"":""AS14061 Digital Ocean, Inc
"",
          ""city"":""Clifton"",
          ""country"":""United States"",
          ""countryCode"":""US"",
          ""isp"":""Digital Ocean"",
          ""lat"":40

          ""org"":""Digital Ocean"",
          ""query"":""104

    });
  }

```typescript
import { SocksClient, SocksClientOptions } from 'socks';

const options: SocksClientOptions = {
  proxy: {
    ipaddress: '104

  },

  destination: {
    host: 'ip-api

    port: 80
  },

  command: 'connect'
};

const client = new SocksClient(options);

client

## Migrating from v1

For the most part, migrating from v1 takes minimal effort as v2 still supports factory creation of proxy connections with callback support


### Notable breaking changes

- In an options object, the proxy 'command' is now required and does not default to 'connect'

- **In an options object, 'target' is now known as 'destination'
**
- Sockets are no longer paused after a SOCKS connection is made, so socket
resume() is no longer required
 (Please be sure to attach data handlers immediately to the Socket to avoid losing data)

- In v2, only the 'connect' command is supported via the factory SocksClient
createConnection function
 (BIND and ASSOCIATE must be used with a SocksClient instance via event handlers)

- In v2, the factory SocksClient
createConnection function callback is called with a single object rather than separate socket and info object

- A SOCKS http/https agent is no longer bundled into the library


For informational purposes, here is the original getting started example from v1 converted to work with v2


### Before (v1)

```javascript
var Socks = require('socks');

var options = {
    proxy: {
        ipaddress: ""202
101
228
108"",
        port: 1080,
        type: 5
    },
    target: {
        host: ""google
com"",
        port: 80
    },
    command: 'connect'
};

Socks
createConnection(options, function(err, socket, info) {
    if (err)
        console
log(err);
    else {
        socket
write(""GET / HTTP/1
1\nHost: google
com\n\n"");
        socket
on('data', function(data) {
            console
log(data
length);
            console
log(data);
        });

        // PLEASE NOTE: sockets need to be resumed before any data will come in or out as they are paused right before this callback is fired

        socket
resume();

        // 569
        // <Buffer 48 54 54 50 2f 31 2e 31 20 33 30 31 20 4d 6f 76 65 64 20 50 65



    }
});
```

### After (v2)
```javascript
const SocksClient = require('socks')
SocksClient;

let options = {
    proxy: {
        ipaddress: ""202
101
228
108"",
        port: 1080,
        type: 5
    },
    destination: {
        host: ""google
com"",
        port: 80
    },
    command: 'connect'
};

SocksClient
createConnection(options, function(err, result) {
    if (err)
        console
log(err);
    else {
        result
socket
write(""GET / HTTP/1
1\nHost: google
com\n\n"");
        result
socket
on('data', function(data) {
            console
log(data
length);
            console



    }
});
```

This is an implementation of wcwidth() and wcswidth() (defined in

1-2001) for Unicode

 Interoperability between terminal-line
applications and (teletype-style) character terminals using the
UTF-8 encoding requires agreement on which character should advance
the cursor by how many cell positions
 No established formal
standards exist at present on which Unicode character shall occupy
how many cell positions on character terminals
 These routines are
a first attempt of defining such behavior based on simple rules
applied to data provided by the Unicode Consortium


For some graphical characters, the Unicode standard explicitly
defines a character-cell width via the definition of the East Asian
FullWidth (F), Wide (W), Half-width (H), and Narrow (Na) classes

In all these cases, there is no ambiguity about which width a
terminal shall use
 For characters in the East Asian Ambiguous (A)
class, the width choice depends purely on a preference of backward
compatibility with either historic CJK or Western practice

Choosing single-width for these characters is easy to justify as
the appropriate long-term solution, as the CJK practice of
displaying these characters as double-width comes from historic
implementation simplicity (8-bit encoded characters were displayed
single-width and 16-bit ones double-width, even for Greek,
Cyrillic, etc


Much less clear is the choice of width for the Not East Asian
(Neutral) class
 Existing practice does not dictate a width for any
of these characters
 It would nevertheless make sense
typographically to allocate two character cells to characters such
as for instance EM SPACE or VOLUME INTEGRAL, which cannot be
represented adequately with a single-width glyph
 The following
routines at present merely assign a single-cell width to all
neutral characters, in the interest of simplicity
 This is not
entirely satisfactory and should be reconsidered before
establishing a formal standard in this area
 At the moment, the
decision which Not East Asian (Neutral) characters should be
represented by double-width glyphs cannot yet be answered by
applying a simple rule from the Unicode database content
 Setting
up a proper standard for the behavior of UTF-8 character terminals
will require a careful analysis not only of each Unicode character,
but also of each presentation form, something the author of these
routines has avoided to do so far

**date-fns** is like [lodash](https://lodash
 It has
[**200+ functions** for all occasions](https://date-fns
org/cldr/charts/32/summary/root
 See:
    // https://en

Contains a number of functions for used by `format`:

```js
var localize = {
  ordinalNumber,
  era,
  quarter,
  month,
  day,
  dayPeriod
}

export default localize
```

#### localize
js'

var eraValues = {
  narrow: ['B', 'A'],
  abbreviated: ['BC', 'AD'],
  wide: ['Before Christ', 'Anno Domini']
}

var localize = {
  // 
js'

var quarterValues = {
  narrow: ['1', '2', '3', '4'],
  abbreviated: ['Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4'],
  wide: ['1st quarter', '2nd quarter', '3rd quarter', '4th quarter']
}

var localize = {
  // 
js'

var dayPeriodValues = {
  narrow: {
    am: 'a',
    pm: 'p',
    midnight: 'mi',
    noon: 'n',
    morning: 'in the morning',
    afternoon: 'in the afternoon',
    evening: 'in the evening',
    night: 'at night'
  },
  abbreviated: {
    am: 'AM',
    pm: 'PM',
    midnight: 'midnight',
    noon: 'noon',
    morning: 'in the morning',
    afternoon: 'in the afternoon',
    evening: 'in the evening',
    night: 'at night'
  },
  wide: {
    am: 'a

  dayPeriod: buildLocalizeFn({
    values: dayPeriodValues,
    defaultWidth: 'wide'
  })
}

export default localize
```

### formatLong

Put this object in `_lib/formatLong/index
js'

var timeFormats = {
  full: 'h:mm:ss a zzzz',
  long: 'h:mm:ss a z',
  medium: 'h:mm:ss a',
  short: 'h:mm a'
}

var formatLong = {
  // 

  time: buildFormatLongFn({
    formats: timeFormats,
    defaultWidth: 'full'
  }),
  // 

  dateTime: buildFormatLongFn({
    formats: dateTimeFormats,
    defaultWidth: 'full'
  })
}

export default formatLong
```

'{{date}}' and '{{time}}' from the strings will be replaced with the date and time respectively
formatDistance('lessThanXMinutes', 5)` would display localized 'less than 5 minutes')
and object with options
/CHANGELOG
 Make sure that the output is valid Markdown and fix if there're any errors
 Since `date-fns` always returns a plain JS Date, which implicitly has the current
system's time zone, helper functions are needed for handling common time zone related use cases
org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateTimeFormat#Browser_compatibility),
and for those that don't a [polyfill](https://github
com/yahoo/date-time-format-timezone) can be used
 The `date-fns` `format` function is extended with support for the `z


```js
// ❌ Wrong!
format(new Date(), 'YYYY-MM-DD')
//=> 2018-10-283

// ✅ Correct

// ❌ Wrong!
parse('11
toString()
//=> 'Sat Jan 11 1986 00:00:00 GMT+0200 (EET)'

// ✅ Correct

title: npm-access
section: 1
description: Set access level on published packages
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm access list packages [<user>|<scope>|<scope:team> [<package>]
npm access list collaborators [<package> [<user>]]
npm access get status [<package>]
npm access set status=public|private [<package>]
npm access set mfa=none|publish|automation [<package>]
npm access grant <read-only|read-write> <scope:team> [<package>]
npm access revoke <scope:team> [<package>]
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

Used to set access controls on private packages


For all of the subcommands, `npm access` will perform actions on the packages
in the current working directory if no package name is passed to the
subcommand


* public / restricted (deprecated):
  Set a package to be either publicly accessible or restricted


* grant / revoke (deprecated):
  Add or remove the ability of users and teams to have read-only or read-write
  access to a package


* 2fa-required / 2fa-not-required (deprecated):
  Configure whether a package requires that anyone publishing it have two-factor
  authentication enabled on their account


* ls-packages (deprecated):
  Show all of the packages a user or a team is able to access, along with the
  access level, except for read-only public packages (it won't print the whole
  registry listing)

* ls-collaborators (deprecated):
  Show all of the access privileges for a package
 Will only show permissions
  for packages to which you have at least read access
 If `<user>` is passed in,
  the list is filtered only to teams _that_ user happens to belong to


* edit (not implemented)

### Details

`npm access` always operates directly on the current registry, configurable
from the command line using `--registry=<registry url>`


Unscoped packages are *always public*


Scoped packages *default to restricted*, but you can either publish them as
public using `npm publish --access=public`, or set their access as public using
`npm access public` after the initial publish


You must have privileges to set the access of a package:

* You are an owner of an unscoped or scoped package

* You are a member of the team that owns a scope

* You have been given read-write privileges for a package, either as a member
  of a team or directly as an owner


If you have two-factor authentication enabled then you'll be prompted to provide a second factor, or may use the `--otp=


` option to specify it on
the command line


If your account is not paid, then attempts to publish scoped packages will
fail with an HTTP 402 status code (logically enough), unless you use
`--access=public`


Management of teams and team memberships is done with the `npm team` command


### Configuration

#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output


* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON
parse() before
  saving them to your `package
json`


Not supported by all npm commands




#### `otp`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator
 It's needed
when publishing or changing package permissions with `npm access`


If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time
password, npm will prompt on the command line for one




#### `registry`

* Default: ""https://registry
npmjs
org/""
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry

title: npm-adduser
section: 1
description: Add a registry user account
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm adduser

alias: add-user
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

Create a new user in the specified registry, and save the credentials to
the `
npmrc` file
 If no registry is specified, the default registry
will be used (see [`registry`](/using-npm/registry))


When using `legacy` for your `auth-type`, the username, password, and
email are read in from prompts


### Configuration

#### `registry`

* Default: ""https://registry
npmjs
org/""
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry




#### `scope`

* Default: the scope of the current project, if any, or """"
* Type: String

Associate an operation with a scope for a scoped registry


Useful when logging in to or out of a private registry:

```
# log in, linking the scope to the custom registry
npm login --scope=@mycorp --registry=https://registry
mycorp
com

# log out, removing the link and the auth token
npm logout --scope=@mycorp
```

This will cause `@mycorp` to be mapped to the registry for future
installation of packages specified according to the pattern
`@mycorp/package`


This will also cause `npm init` to create a scoped package


```
# accept all defaults, and create a package named ""@foo/whatever"",
# instead of just named ""whatever""
npm init --scope=@foo --yes
```



#### `auth-type`

* Default: ""web""
* Type: ""legacy"" or ""web""

What authentication strategy to use with `login`
 Note that if an `otp`
config is given, this value will always be set to `legacy`

title: npm-audit
section: 1
description: Run a security audit
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm audit [fix|signatures]
```

### Description

The audit command submits a description of the dependencies configured in
your project to your default registry and asks for a report of known
vulnerabilities
  If any vulnerabilities are found, then the impact and
appropriate remediation will be calculated
  If the `fix` argument is
provided, then remediations will be applied to the package tree


The command will exit with a 0 exit code if no vulnerabilities were found


Note that some vulnerabilities cannot be fixed automatically and will
require manual intervention or review
  Also note that since `npm audit
fix` runs a full-fledged `npm install` under the hood, all configs that
apply to the installer will also apply to `npm install` -- so things like
`npm audit fix --package-lock-only` will work as expected


By default, the audit command will exit with a non-zero code if any
vulnerability is found
 It may be useful in CI environments to include the
`--audit-level` parameter to specify the minimum vulnerability level that
will cause the command to fail
 This option does not filter the report
output, it simply changes the command's failure threshold


### Package lock

By default npm requires a package-lock or shrinkwrap in order to run the
audit
  You can bypass the package lock with `--no-package-lock` but be
aware the results may be different with every run, since npm will
re-build the dependency tree each time


### Audit Signatures

To ensure the integrity of packages you download from the public npm registry, or any registry that supports signatures, you can verify the registry signatures of downloaded packages using the npm CLI


Registry signatures can be verified using the following `audit` command:

```bash
$ npm audit signatures
```

The `audit signatures` command will also verify the provenance attestations of
downloaded packages
 Because provenance attestations are such a new feature,
security features may be added to (or changed in) the attestation format over
time
 To ensure that you're always able to verify attestation signatures check
that you're running the latest version of the npm CLI
 Please note this often
means updating npm beyond the version that ships with Node
js


The npm CLI supports registry signatures and signing keys provided by any registry if the following conventions are followed:

1
 Signatures are provided in the package's `packument` in each published version within the `dist` object:

```json
""dist"":{
  ""

omitted

"": ""

omitted

"",
  ""signatures"": [{
    ""keyid"": ""SHA256:{{SHA256_PUBLIC_KEY}}"",
    ""sig"": ""a312b9c3cb4a1b693e8ebac5ee1ca9cc01f2661c14391917dcb111517f72370809


""
  }]
}
```

See this [example](https://registry
npmjs
4
3) of a signed package from the public npm registry


The `sig` is generated using the following template: `${package
name}@${package
version}:${package
dist
integrity}` and the `keyid` has to match one of the public signing keys below


2
 Public signing keys are provided at `registry-host
tld/-/npm/v1/keys` in the following format:

```
{
  ""keys"": [{
    ""expires"": null,
    ""keyid"": ""SHA256:{{SHA256_PUBLIC_KEY}}"",
    ""keytype"": ""ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"",
    ""scheme"": ""ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"",
    ""key"": ""{{B64_PUBLIC_KEY}}""
  }]
}
```

Keys response:

- `expires`: null or a simplified extended [ISO 8601 format](https://en
wikipedia
org/wiki/ISO_8601): `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss
sssZ`
- `keydid`: sha256 fingerprint of the public key
- `keytype`: only `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` is currently supported by the npm CLI
- `scheme`: only `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` is currently supported by the npm CLI
- `key`: base64 encoded public key

See this [example key's response from the public npm registry](https://registry
npmjs
org/-/npm/v1/keys)


### Audit Endpoints

There are two audit endpoints that npm may use to fetch vulnerability
information: the `Bulk Advisory` endpoint and the `Quick Audit` endpoint


#### Bulk Advisory Endpoint

As of version 7, npm uses the much faster `Bulk Advisory` endpoint to
optimize the speed of calculating audit results


npm will generate a JSON payload with the name and list of versions of each
package in the tree, and POST it to the default configured registry at
the path `/-/npm/v1/security/advisories/bulk`


Any packages in the tree that do not have a `version` field in their
package
json file will be ignored
  If any `--omit` options are specified
(either via the [`--omit` config](/using-npm/config#omit), or one of the
shorthands such as `--production`, `--only=dev`, and so on), then packages will
be omitted from the submitted payload as appropriate


If the registry responds with an error, or with an invalid response, then
npm will attempt to load advisory data from the `Quick Audit` endpoint


The expected result will contain a set of advisory objects for each
dependency that matches the advisory range
  Each advisory object contains
a `name`, `url`, `id`, `severity`, `vulnerable_versions`, and `title`


npm then uses these advisory objects to calculate vulnerabilities and
meta-vulnerabilities of the dependencies within the tree


#### Quick Audit Endpoint

If the `Bulk Advisory` endpoint returns an error, or invalid data, npm will
attempt to load advisory data from the `Quick Audit` endpoint, which is
considerably slower in most cases


The full package tree as found in `package-lock
json` is submitted, along
with the following pieces of additional metadata:

* `npm_version`
* `node_version`
* `platform`
* `arch`
* `node_env`

All packages in the tree are submitted to the Quick Audit endpoint

Omitted dependency types are skipped when generating the report


#### Scrubbing

Out of an abundance of caution, npm versions 5 and 6 would ""scrub"" any
packages from the submitted report if their name contained a `/` character,
so as to avoid leaking the names of potentially private packages or git
URLs


This scrubbing has been removed from npm as of version 7


#### Calculating Meta-Vulnerabilities and Remediations

npm uses the
[`@npmcli/metavuln-calculator`](http://npm
im/@npmcli/metavuln-calculator)
module to turn a set of security advisories into a set of ""vulnerability""
objects
  A ""meta-vulnerability"" is a dependency that is vulnerable by
virtue of dependence on vulnerable versions of a vulnerable package


For example, if the package `foo` is vulnerable in the range `>=1
0
2
<2
0
0`, and the package `bar` depends on `foo@^1
1
0`, then that version
of `bar` can only be installed by installing a vulnerable version of `foo`

In this case, `bar` is a ""metavulnerability""


Once metavulnerabilities for a given package are calculated, they are
cached in the `~/
npm` folder and only re-evaluated if the advisory range
changes, or a new version of the package is published (in which case, the
new version is checked for metavulnerable status as well)


If the chain of metavulnerabilities extends all the way to the root
project, and it cannot be updated without changing its dependency ranges,
then `npm audit fix` will require the `--force` option to apply the
remediation
  If remediations do not require changes to the dependency
ranges, then all vulnerable packages will be updated to a version that does
not have an advisory or metavulnerability posted against it


### Exit Code

The `npm audit` command will exit with a 0 exit code if no vulnerabilities
were found
  The `npm audit fix` command will exit with 0 exit code if no
vulnerabilities are found _or_ if the remediation is able to successfully
fix all vulnerabilities


If vulnerabilities were found the exit code will depend on the
[`audit-level` config](/using-npm/config#audit-level)


### Examples

Scan your project for vulnerabilities and automatically install any compatible
updates to vulnerable dependencies:

```bash
$ npm audit fix
```

Run `audit fix` without modifying `node_modules`, but still updating the
pkglock:

```bash
$ npm audit fix --package-lock-only
```

Skip updating `devDependencies`:

```bash
$ npm audit fix --only=prod
```

Have `audit fix` install SemVer-major updates to toplevel dependencies, not
just SemVer-compatible ones:

```bash
$ npm audit fix --force
```

Do a dry run to get an idea of what `audit fix` will do, and _also_ output
install information in JSON format:

```bash
$ npm audit fix --dry-run --json
```

Scan your project for vulnerabilities and just show the details, without
fixing anything:

```bash
$ npm audit
```

Get the detailed audit report in JSON format:

```bash
$ npm audit --json
```

Fail an audit only if the results include a vulnerability with a level of moderate or higher:

```bash
$ npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

### Configuration

#### `audit-level`

* Default: null
* Type: null, ""info"", ""low"", ""moderate"", ""high"", ""critical"", or ""none""

The minimum level of vulnerability for `npm audit` to exit with a non-zero
exit code




#### `dry-run`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done
 This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, `install`, `update`,
`dedupe`, `uninstall`, as well as `pack` and `publish`


Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg `dist-tags`,
`owner`, etc




#### `force`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Removes various protections against unfortunate side effects, common
mistakes, unnecessary performance degradation, and malicious input


* Allow clobbering non-npm files in global installs

* Allow the `npm version` command to work on an unclean git repository

* Allow deleting the cache folder with `npm cache clean`

* Allow installing packages that have an `engines` declaration requiring a
  different version of npm

* Allow installing packages that have an `engines` declaration requiring a
  different version of `node`, even if `--engine-strict` is enabled

* Allow `npm audit fix` to install modules outside your stated dependency
  range (including SemVer-major changes)

* Allow unpublishing all versions of a published package

* Allow conflicting peerDependencies to be installed in the root project

* Implicitly set `--yes` during `npm init`

* Allow clobbering existing values in `npm pkg`
* Allow unpublishing of entire packages (not just a single version)


If you don't have a clear idea of what you want to do, it is strongly
recommended that you do not use this option!



#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output


* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON
parse() before
  saving them to your `package
json`


Not supported by all npm commands




#### `package-lock-only`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to true, the current operation will only use the `package-lock
json`,
ignoring `node_modules`


For `update` this means only the `package-lock
json` will be updated,
instead of checking `node_modules` and downloading dependencies


For `list` this means the output will be based on the tree described by the
`package-lock
json`, rather than the contents of `node_modules`




#### `package-lock`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

If set to false, then ignore `package-lock
json` files when installing
 This
will also prevent _writing_ `package-lock
json` if `save` is true




#### `omit`

* Default: 'dev' if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to
  'production', otherwise empty

* Type: ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk


Note that these dependencies _are_ still resolved and added to the
`package-lock
json` or `npm-shrinkwrap
json` file
 They are just not
physically installed on disk


If a package type appears in both the `--include` and `--omit` lists, then
it will be included


If the resulting omit list includes `'dev'`, then the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable will be set to `'production'` for all lifecycle scripts




#### `include`

* Default:
* Type: ""prod"", ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Option that allows for defining which types of dependencies to install


This is the inverse of `--omit=<type>`


Dependency types specified in `--include` will not be omitted, regardless of
the order in which omit/include are specified on the command-line




#### `foreground-scripts`

* Default: `false` unless when using `npm pack` or `npm publish` where it
  defaults to `true`
* Type: Boolean

Run all build scripts (ie, `preinstall`, `install`, and `postinstall`)
scripts for installed packages in the foreground process, sharing standard
input, output, and error with the main npm process


Note that this will generally make installs run slower, and be much noisier,
but can be useful for debugging




#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package
json files


Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they
will *not* run any pre- or post-scripts




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `install-links`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When set file: protocol dependencies will be packed and installed as regular
dependencies instead of creating a symlink
 This option has no effect on
workspaces

title: npm-cache
section: 1
description: Manipulates packages cache
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm cache add <package-spec>
npm cache clean [<key>]
npm cache ls [<name>@<version>]
npm cache verify
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

Used to add, list, or clean the npm cache folder


* add:
  Add the specified packages to the local cache
  This command is primarily
  intended to be used internally by npm, but it can provide a way to
  add data to the local installation cache explicitly


* clean:
  Delete all data out of the cache folder


* verify:
  Verify the contents of the cache folder, garbage collecting any unneeded
  data, and verifying the integrity of the cache index and all cached data


### Details

npm stores cache data in an opaque directory within the configured `cache`,
named `_cacache`
 This directory is a
[`cacache`](http://npm
im/cacache)-based content-addressable cache that
stores all http request data as well as other package-related data
 This
directory is primarily accessed through `pacote`, the library responsible
for all package fetching as of npm@5


All data that passes through the cache is fully verified for integrity on
both insertion and extraction
 Cache corruption will either trigger an
error, or signal to `pacote` that the data must be refetched, which it will
do automatically
 For this reason, it should never be necessary to clear
the cache for any reason other than reclaiming disk space, thus why `clean`
now requires `--force` to run


There is currently no method exposed through npm to inspect or directly
manage the contents of this cache
 In order to access it, `cacache` must be
used directly


npm will not remove data by itself: the cache will grow as new packages are
installed


### A note about the cache's design

The npm cache is strictly a cache: it should not be relied upon as a
persistent and reliable data store for package data
 npm makes no guarantee
that a previously-cached piece of data will be available later, and will
automatically delete corrupted contents
 The primary guarantee that the
cache makes is that, if it does return data, that data will be exactly the
data that was inserted


To run an offline verification of existing cache contents, use `npm cache
verify`


### Configuration

#### `cache`

* Default: Windows: `%LocalAppData%\npm-cache`, Posix: `~/
npm`
* Type: Path

The location of npm's cache directory

title: npm-ci
section: 1
description: Clean install a project
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm ci

aliases: clean-install, ic, install-clean, isntall-clean
```

### Description

This command is similar to [`npm install`](/commands/npm-install), except
it's meant to be used in automated environments such as test platforms,
continuous integration, and deployment -- or any situation where you want
to make sure you're doing a clean install of your dependencies


The main differences between using `npm install` and `npm ci` are:

* The project **must** have an existing `package-lock
json` or
  `npm-shrinkwrap
json`

* If dependencies in the package lock do not match those in `package
json`,
  `npm ci` will exit with an error, instead of updating the package lock

* `npm ci` can only install entire projects at a time: individual
  dependencies cannot be added with this command

* If a `node_modules` is already present, it will be automatically removed
  before `npm ci` begins its install

* It will never write to `package
json` or any of the package-locks:
  installs are essentially frozen


NOTE: If you create your `package-lock
json` file by running `npm install`
with flags that can affect the shape of your dependency tree, such as
`--legacy-peer-deps` or `--install-links`, you _must_ provide the same
flags to `npm ci` or you are likely to encounter errors
 An easy way to do
this is to run, for example,
`npm config set legacy-peer-deps=true --location=project` and commit the
`
npmrc` file to your repo


### Example

Make sure you have a package-lock and an up-to-date install:

```bash
$ cd 
/my/npm/project
$ npm install
added 154 packages in 10s
$ ls | grep package-lock
```

Run `npm ci` in that project

```bash
$ npm ci
added 154 packages in 5s
```

Configure Travis CI to build using `npm ci` instead of `npm install`:

```bash
# 
travis
yml
install:
- npm ci
# keep the npm cache around to speed up installs
cache:
  directories:
  - ""$HOME/
npm""
```

### Configuration

#### `install-strategy`

* Default: ""hoisted""
* Type: ""hoisted"", ""nested"", ""shallow"", or ""linked""

Sets the strategy for installing packages in node_modules
 hoisted
(default): Install non-duplicated in top-level, and duplicated as necessary
within directory structure
 nested: (formerly --legacy-bundling) install in
place, no hoisting
 shallow (formerly --global-style) only install direct
deps at top-level
 linked: (experimental) install in node_modules/
store,
link in place, unhoisted




#### `legacy-bundling`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=nested`

Instead of hoisting package installs in `node_modules`, install packages in
the same manner that they are depended on
 This may cause very deep
directory structures and duplicate package installs as there is no
de-duplicating
 Sets `--install-strategy=nested`




#### `global-style`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=shallow`

Only install direct dependencies in the top level `node_modules`, but hoist
on deeper dependencies
 Sets `--install-strategy=shallow`




#### `omit`

* Default: 'dev' if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to
  'production', otherwise empty

* Type: ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk


Note that these dependencies _are_ still resolved and added to the
`package-lock
json` or `npm-shrinkwrap
json` file
 They are just not
physically installed on disk


If a package type appears in both the `--include` and `--omit` lists, then
it will be included


If the resulting omit list includes `'dev'`, then the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable will be set to `'production'` for all lifecycle scripts




#### `include`

* Default:
* Type: ""prod"", ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Option that allows for defining which types of dependencies to install


This is the inverse of `--omit=<type>`


Dependency types specified in `--include` will not be omitted, regardless of
the order in which omit/include are specified on the command-line




#### `strict-peer-deps`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to `true`, and `--legacy-peer-deps` is not set, then _any_
conflicting `peerDependencies` will be treated as an install failure, even
if npm could reasonably guess the appropriate resolution based on non-peer
dependency relationships


By default, conflicting `peerDependencies` deep in the dependency graph will
be resolved using the nearest non-peer dependency specification, even if
doing so will result in some packages receiving a peer dependency outside
the range set in their package's `peerDependencies` object


When such an override is performed, a warning is printed, explaining the
conflict and the packages involved
 If `--strict-peer-deps` is set, then
this warning is treated as a failure




#### `foreground-scripts`

* Default: `false` unless when using `npm pack` or `npm publish` where it
  defaults to `true`
* Type: Boolean

Run all build scripts (ie, `preinstall`, `install`, and `postinstall`)
scripts for installed packages in the foreground process, sharing standard
input, output, and error with the main npm process


Note that this will generally make installs run slower, and be much noisier,
but can be useful for debugging




#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package
json files


Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they
will *not* run any pre- or post-scripts




#### `audit`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When ""true"" submit audit reports alongside the current npm command to the
default registry and all registries configured for scopes
 See the
documentation for [`npm audit`](/commands/npm-audit) for details on what is
submitted




#### `bin-links`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Tells npm to create symlinks (or `
cmd` shims on Windows) for package
executables


Set to false to have it not do this




#### `fund`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When ""true"" displays the message at the end of each `npm install`
acknowledging the number of dependencies looking for funding
 See [`npm
fund`](/commands/npm-fund) for details




#### `dry-run`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done
 This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, `install`, `update`,
`dedupe`, `uninstall`, as well as `pack` and `publish`


Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg `dist-tags`,
`owner`, etc




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `install-links`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When set file: protocol dependencies will be packed and installed as regular

title: npm-completion
section: 1
description: Tab Completion for npm
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm completion
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

Enables tab-completion in all npm commands


The synopsis above
loads the completions into your current shell
  Adding it to
your ~/
bashrc or ~/
zshrc will make the completions available
everywhere:

```bash
npm completion >> ~/
bashrc
npm completion >> ~/
zshrc
```

You may of course also pipe the output of `npm completion` to a file
such as `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion
d/npm` or 
`/etc/bash_completion
d/npm` if you have a system that will read 
that file for you


When `COMP_CWORD`, `COMP_LINE`, and `COMP_POINT` are defined in the
environment, `npm completion` acts in ""plumbing mode"", and outputs
completions based on the arguments

title: npm-config
section: 1
description: Manage the npm configuration files
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm config set <key>=<value> [<key>=<value> 


]
npm config get [<key> [<key> 


]]
npm config delete <key> [<key> 


]
npm config list [--json]
npm config edit
npm config fix

alias: c
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

npm gets its config settings from the command line, environment
variables, `npmrc` files, and in some cases, the `package
json` file


See [npmrc](/configuring-npm/npmrc) for more information about the npmrc
files


See [config](/using-npm/config) for a more thorough explanation of the
mechanisms involved, and a full list of config options available


The `npm config` command can be used to update and edit the contents
of the user and global npmrc files


### Sub-commands

Config supports the following sub-commands:

#### set

```bash
npm config set key=value [key=value


]
npm set key=value [key=value


]
```

Sets each of the config keys to the value provided
 Modifies the user configuration
file unless [`location`](/commands/npm-config#location) is passed


If value is omitted, the key will be removed from your config file entirely


Note: for backwards compatibility, `npm config set key value` is supported
as an alias for `npm config set key=value`


#### get

```bash
npm config get [key 


]
npm get [key 


]
```

Echo the config value(s) to stdout


If multiple keys are provided, then the values will be prefixed with the
key names


If no keys are provided, then this command behaves the same as `npm config
list`


#### list

```bash
npm config list
```

Show all the config settings
 Use `-l` to also show defaults
 Use `--json`
to show the settings in json format


#### delete

```bash
npm config delete key [key 


]
```

Deletes the specified keys from all configuration files


#### edit

```bash
npm config edit
```

Opens the config file in an editor
  Use the `--global` flag to edit the
global config


#### fix

```bash
npm config fix
```

Attempts to repair invalid configuration items
  Usually this means
attaching authentication config (i
e
 `_auth`, `_authToken`) to the
configured `registry`


### Configuration

#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output


* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON
parse() before
  saving them to your `package
json`


Not supported by all npm commands




#### `global`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Operates in ""global"" mode, so that packages are installed into the `prefix`
folder instead of the current working directory
 See
[folders](/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior


* packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead
  of the current working directory

* bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
* man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`



#### `editor`

* Default: The EDITOR or VISUAL environment variables, or
  '%SYSTEMROOT%\notepad
exe' on Windows, or 'vi' on Unix systems
* Type: String

The command to run for `npm edit` and `npm config edit`




#### `location`

* Default: ""user"" unless `--global` is passed, which will also set this value
  to ""global""
* Type: ""global"", ""user"", or ""project""

When passed to `npm config` this refers to which config file to use


When set to ""global"" mode, packages are installed into the `prefix` folder
instead of the current working directory
 See
[folders](/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior


* packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead
  of the current working directory

* bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
* man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`



#### `long`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Show extended information in `ls`, `search`, and `help-search`

title: npm-dedupe
section: 1
description: Reduce duplication in the package tree
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm dedupe

alias: ddp
```

### Description

Searches the local package tree and attempts to simplify the overall
structure by moving dependencies further up the tree, where they can
be more effectively shared by multiple dependent packages


For example, consider this dependency graph:

```
a
+-- b <-- depends on c@1
0
x
|   `-- c@1
0
3
`-- d <-- depends on c@~1
0
9
    `-- c@1
0
10
```

In this case, `npm dedupe` will transform the tree to:

```bash
a
+-- b
+-- d
`-- c@1
0
10
```

Because of the hierarchical nature of node's module lookup, b and d
will both get their dependency met by the single c package at the root
level of the tree


In some cases, you may have a dependency graph like this:

```
a
+-- b <-- depends on c@1
0
x
+-- c@1
0
3
`-- d <-- depends on c@1
x
    `-- c@1
9
9
```

During the installation process, the `c@1
0
3` dependency for `b` was
placed in the root of the tree
  Though `d`'s dependency on `c@1
x` could
have been satisfied by `c@1
0
3`, the newer `c@1
9
0` dependency was used,
because npm favors updates by default, even when doing so causes
duplication


Running `npm dedupe` will cause npm to note the duplication and
re-evaluate, deleting the nested `c` module, because the one in the root is
sufficient


To prefer deduplication over novelty during the installation process, run
`npm install --prefer-dedupe` or `npm config set prefer-dedupe true`


Arguments are ignored
 Dedupe always acts on the entire tree


Note that this operation transforms the dependency tree, but will never
result in new modules being installed


Using `npm find-dupes` will run the command in `--dry-run` mode


Note: `npm dedupe` will never update the semver values of direct
dependencies in your project `package
json`, if you want to update
values in `package
json` you can run: `npm update --save` instead


### Configuration

#### `install-strategy`

* Default: ""hoisted""
* Type: ""hoisted"", ""nested"", ""shallow"", or ""linked""

Sets the strategy for installing packages in node_modules
 hoisted
(default): Install non-duplicated in top-level, and duplicated as necessary
within directory structure
 nested: (formerly --legacy-bundling) install in
place, no hoisting
 shallow (formerly --global-style) only install direct
deps at top-level
 linked: (experimental) install in node_modules/
store,
link in place, unhoisted




#### `legacy-bundling`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=nested`

Instead of hoisting package installs in `node_modules`, install packages in
the same manner that they are depended on
 This may cause very deep
directory structures and duplicate package installs as there is no
de-duplicating
 Sets `--install-strategy=nested`




#### `global-style`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=shallow`

Only install direct dependencies in the top level `node_modules`, but hoist
on deeper dependencies
 Sets `--install-strategy=shallow`




#### `strict-peer-deps`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to `true`, and `--legacy-peer-deps` is not set, then _any_
conflicting `peerDependencies` will be treated as an install failure, even
if npm could reasonably guess the appropriate resolution based on non-peer
dependency relationships


By default, conflicting `peerDependencies` deep in the dependency graph will
be resolved using the nearest non-peer dependency specification, even if
doing so will result in some packages receiving a peer dependency outside
the range set in their package's `peerDependencies` object


When such an override is performed, a warning is printed, explaining the
conflict and the packages involved
 If `--strict-peer-deps` is set, then
this warning is treated as a failure




#### `package-lock`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

If set to false, then ignore `package-lock
json` files when installing
 This
will also prevent _writing_ `package-lock
json` if `save` is true




#### `omit`

* Default: 'dev' if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to
  'production', otherwise empty

* Type: ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk


Note that these dependencies _are_ still resolved and added to the
`package-lock
json` or `npm-shrinkwrap
json` file
 They are just not
physically installed on disk


If a package type appears in both the `--include` and `--omit` lists, then
it will be included


If the resulting omit list includes `'dev'`, then the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable will be set to `'production'` for all lifecycle scripts




#### `include`

* Default:
* Type: ""prod"", ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Option that allows for defining which types of dependencies to install


This is the inverse of `--omit=<type>`


Dependency types specified in `--include` will not be omitted, regardless of
the order in which omit/include are specified on the command-line




#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package
json files


Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they
will *not* run any pre- or post-scripts




#### `audit`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When ""true"" submit audit reports alongside the current npm command to the
default registry and all registries configured for scopes
 See the
documentation for [`npm audit`](/commands/npm-audit) for details on what is
submitted




#### `bin-links`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Tells npm to create symlinks (or `
cmd` shims on Windows) for package
executables


Set to false to have it not do this




#### `fund`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When ""true"" displays the message at the end of each `npm install`
acknowledging the number of dependencies looking for funding
 See [`npm
fund`](/commands/npm-fund) for details




#### `dry-run`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done
 This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, `install`, `update`,
`dedupe`, `uninstall`, as well as `pack` and `publish`


Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg `dist-tags`,
`owner`, etc




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `install-links`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When set file: protocol dependencies will be packed and installed as regular
dependencies instead of creating a symlink
 This option has no effect on
workspaces

title: npm-deprecate
section: 1
description: Deprecate a version of a package
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm deprecate <package-spec> <message>
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

This command will update the npm registry entry for a package, providing a
deprecation warning to all who attempt to install it


It works on [version ranges](https://semver
npmjs
com/) as well as specific
versions, so you can do something like this:

```bash
npm deprecate my-thing@""< 0
2
3"" ""critical bug fixed in v0
2
3""
```

SemVer ranges passed to this command are interpreted such that they *do*
include prerelease versions
  For example:

```bash
npm deprecate my-thing@1
x ""1
x is no longer supported""
```

In this case, a version `my-thing@1
0
0-beta
0` will also be deprecated
  See the `owner` and
`adduser` help topics


To un-deprecate a package, specify an empty string (`""""`) for the `message`
argument
 Note that you must use double quotes with no space between them to
format an empty string


### Configuration

#### `registry`

* Default: ""https://registry
npmjs
org/""
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry




#### `otp`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator
 It's needed
when publishing or changing package permissions with `npm access`


If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time
password, npm will prompt on the command line for one

title: npm-diff
section: 1
description: The registry diff command
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm diff [


<paths>]
```

### Description

Similar to its `git diff` counterpart, this command will print diff patches
of files for packages published to the npm registry


* `npm diff --diff=<spec-a> --diff=<spec-b>`

    Compares two package versions using their registry specifiers, e
g:
    `npm diff --diff=pkg@1
0
0 --diff=pkg@^2
0
0`
 It's also possible to
    compare across forks of any package,
    e
g: `npm diff --diff=pkg@1
0
0 --diff=pkg-fork@1
0
0`


    Any valid spec can be used, so that it's also possible to compare
    directories or git repositories,
    e
g: `npm diff --diff=pkg@latest --diff=
/packages/pkg`

    Here's an example comparing two different versions of a package named
    `abbrev` from the registry:

    ```bash
    npm diff --diff=abbrev@1
1
0 --diff=abbrev@1
1
1
    ```

    On success, output looks like:

    ```bash
    diff --git a/package
json b/package
json
    index v1
1
0

v1
1
1 100644
    --- a/package
json
    +++ b/package
json
    @@ -1,6 +1,6 @@
     {
       ""name"": ""abbrev"",
    -  ""version"": ""1
1
0"",
    +  ""version"": ""1
1
1"",
       ""description"": ""Like ruby's abbrev module, but in js"",
       ""author"": ""Isaac Z
 Schlueter <i@izs
me>"",
       ""main"": ""abbrev
js"",
    ```

    Given the flexible nature of npm specs, you can also target local
    directories or git repos just like when using `npm install`:

    ```bash
    npm diff --diff=https://github
com/npm/libnpmdiff --diff=
/local-path
    ```

    In the example above we can compare the contents from the package installed
    from the git repo at `github
com/npm/libnpmdiff` with the contents of the
    `
/local-path` that contains a valid package, such as a modified copy of
    the original


* `npm diff` (in a package directory, no arguments):

    If the package is published to the registry, `npm diff` will fetch the
    tarball version tagged as `latest` (this value can be configured using the
    `tag` option) and proceed to compare the contents of files present in that
    tarball, with the current files in your local file system


    This workflow provides a handy way for package authors to see what
    package-tracked files have been changed in comparison with the latest
    published version of that package


* `npm diff --diff=<pkg-name>` (in a package directory):

    When using a single package name (with no version or tag specifier) as an
    argument, `npm diff` will work in a similar way to
    [`npm-outdated`](npm-outdated) and reach for the registry to figure out
    what current published version of the package named `<pkg-name>`
    will satisfy its dependent declared semver-range
 Once that specific
    version is known `npm diff` will print diff patches comparing the
    current version of `<pkg-name>` found in the local file system with
    that specific version returned by the registry


    Given a package named `abbrev` that is currently installed:

    ```bash
    npm diff --diff=abbrev
    ```

    That will request from the registry its most up to date version and
    will print a diff output comparing the currently installed version to this
    newer one if the version numbers are not the same


* `npm diff --diff=<spec-a>` (in a package directory):

    Similar to using only a single package name, it's also possible to declare
    a full registry specifier version if you wish to compare the local version
    of an installed package with the specific version/tag/semver-range provided
    in `<spec-a>`


    An example: assuming `pkg@1
0
0` is installed in the current `node_modules`
    folder, running:

    ```bash
    npm diff --diff=pkg@2
0
0
    ```

    It will effectively be an alias to
    `npm diff --diff=pkg@1
0
0 --diff=pkg@2
0
0`


* `npm diff --diff=<semver-a> [--diff=<semver-b>]` (in a package directory):

    Using `npm diff` along with semver-valid version numbers is a shorthand
    to compare different versions of the current package


    It needs to be run from a package directory, such that for a package named
    `pkg` running `npm diff --diff=1
0
0 --diff=1
0
1` is the same as running
    `npm diff --diff=pkg@1
0
0 --diff=pkg@1
0
1`


    If only a single argument `<version-a>` is provided, then the current local
    file system is going to be compared against that version


    Here's an example comparing two specific versions (published to the
    configured registry) of the current project directory:

    ```bash
    npm diff --diff=1
0
0 --diff=1
1
0
    ```

Note that tag names are not valid `--diff` argument values, if you wish to
compare to a published tag, you must use the `pkg@tagname` syntax


#### Filtering files

It's possible to also specify positional arguments using file names or globs
pattern matching in order to limit the result of diff patches to only a subset
of files for a given package, e
g:

  ```bash
  npm diff --diff=pkg@2 
/lib/ CHANGELOG
md
  ```

In the example above the diff output is only going to print contents of files
located within the folder `
/lib/` and changed lines of code within the
`CHANGELOG
md` file


### Configuration

#### `diff`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Define arguments to compare in `npm diff`




#### `diff-name-only`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Prints only filenames when using `npm diff`




#### `diff-unified`

* Default: 3
* Type: Number

The number of lines of context to print in `npm diff`




#### `diff-ignore-all-space`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Ignore whitespace when comparing lines in `npm diff`




#### `diff-no-prefix`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Do not show any source or destination prefix in `npm diff` output


Note: this causes `npm diff` to ignore the `--diff-src-prefix` and
`--diff-dst-prefix` configs




#### `diff-src-prefix`

* Default: ""a/""
* Type: String

Source prefix to be used in `npm diff` output




#### `diff-dst-prefix`

* Default: ""b/""
* Type: String

Destination prefix to be used in `npm diff` output




#### `diff-text`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Treat all files as text in `npm diff`




#### `global`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Operates in ""global"" mode, so that packages are installed into the `prefix`
folder instead of the current working directory
 See
[folders](/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior


* packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead
  of the current working directory

* bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
* man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`



#### `tag`

* Default: ""latest""
* Type: String

If you ask npm to install a package and don't tell it a specific version,
then it will install the specified tag


Also the tag that is added to the package@version specified by the `npm tag`
command, if no explicit tag is given


When used by the `npm diff` command, this is the tag used to fetch the
tarball that will be compared with the local files by default




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes

title: npm-dist-tag
section: 1
description: Modify package distribution tags
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm dist-tag add <package-spec (with version)> [<tag>]
npm dist-tag rm <package-spec> <tag>
npm dist-tag ls [<package-spec>]

alias: dist-tags
```

### Description

Add, remove, and enumerate distribution tags on a package:

* add: Tags the specified version of the package with the specified tag,
  or the [`--tag` config](/using-npm/config#tag) if not specified
 If you have
  two-factor authentication on auth-and-writes then you’ll need to include a
  one-time password on the command line with
  `--otp <one-time password>`, or go through a second factor flow based on your `authtype`


* rm: Clear a tag that is no longer in use from the package
 If you have
  two-factor authentication on auth-and-writes then you’ll need to include
  a one-time password on the command line with `--otp <one-time password>`,
  or go through a second factor flow based on your `authtype`

* ls: Show all of the dist-tags for a package, defaulting to the package in
  the current prefix
 This is the default action if none is specified


A tag can be used when installing packages as a reference to a version instead
of using a specific version number:

```bash
npm install <name>@<tag>
```

When installing dependencies, a preferred tagged version may be specified:

```bash
npm install --tag <tag>
```

(This also applies to any other commands that resolve and install
dependencies, such as `npm dedupe`, `npm update`, and `npm audit fix`
)

Publishing a package sets the `latest` tag to the published version unless the
`--tag` option is used
 For example, `npm publish --tag=beta`


By default, `npm install <pkg>` (without any `@<version>` or `@<tag>`
specifier) installs the `latest` tag


### Purpose

Tags can be used to provide an alias instead of version numbers


For example, a project might choose to have multiple streams of development
and use a different tag for each stream, e
g
, `stable`, `beta`, `dev`,
`canary`


By default, the `latest` tag is used by npm to identify the current version
of a package, and `npm install <pkg>` (without any `@<version>` or `@<tag>`
specifier) installs the `latest` tag
 Typically, projects only use the
`latest` tag for stable release versions, and use other tags for unstable
versions such as prereleases


The `next` tag is used by some projects to identify the upcoming version


Other than `latest`, no tag has any special significance to npm itself


### Caveats

This command used to be known as `npm tag`, which only created new tags,
and so had a different syntax


Tags must share a namespace with version numbers, because they are
specified in the same slot: `npm install <pkg>@<version>` vs
`npm install <pkg>@<tag>`


Tags that can be interpreted as valid semver ranges will be rejected
 For
example, `v1
4` cannot be used as a tag, because it is interpreted by
semver as `>=1
4
0 <1
5
0`
  See <https://github
com/npm/npm/issues/6082>


The simplest way to avoid semver problems with tags is to use tags that do
not begin with a number or the letter `v`


### Configuration

#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names

workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc

description: Open documentation for a package in a web browser
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm docs [<pkgname> [<pkgname> 


]]

alias: home
```

### Description

This command tries to guess at the likely location of a package's
documentation URL, and then tries to open it using the
[`--browser` config](/using-npm/config#browser) param
 You can pass multiple
package names at once
 If no package name is provided, it will search for a
`package
json` in the current folder and use the `name` property


### Configuration

#### `browser`

* Default: OS X: `""open""`, Windows: `""start""`, Others: `""xdg-open""`
* Type: null, Boolean, or String

The browser that is called by npm commands to open websites


Set to `false` to suppress browser behavior and instead print urls to
terminal


Set to `true` to use default system URL opener




#### `registry`

* Default: ""https://registry
npmjs
org/""
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project

title: npm-doctor
section: 1
description: Check the health of your npm environment
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm doctor [ping] [registry] [versions] [environment] [permissions] [cache]
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

`npm doctor` runs a set of checks to ensure that your npm installation has
what it needs to manage your JavaScript packages
 npm is mostly a
standalone tool, but it does have some basic requirements that must be met:

+ Node
js and git must be executable by npm

+ The primary npm registry, `registry
npmjs
com`, or another service that
  uses the registry API, is available

+ The directories that npm uses, `node_modules` (both locally and
  globally), exist and can be written by the current user

+ The npm cache exists, and the package tarballs within it aren't corrupt


Without all of these working properly, npm may not work properly
  Many
issues are often attributable to things that are outside npm's code base,
so `npm doctor` confirms that the npm installation is in a good state


Also, in addition to this, there are also very many issue reports due to
using old versions of npm
 Since npm is constantly improving, running
`npm@latest` is better than an old version


`npm doctor` verifies the following items in your environment, and if
there are any recommended changes, it will display them
  By default npm
runs all of these checks
 You can limit what checks are ran by
specifying them as extra arguments


#### `npm ping`

By default, npm installs from the primary npm registry,
`registry
npmjs
org`
  `npm doctor` hits a special ping endpoint within the
registry
 This can also be checked with `npm ping`
 If this check fails,
you may be using a proxy that needs to be configured, or may need to talk
to your IT staff to get access over HTTPS to `registry
npmjs
org`


This check is done against whichever registry you've configured (you can
see what that is by running `npm config get registry`), and if you're using
a private registry that doesn't support the `/whoami` endpoint supported by
the primary registry, this check may fail


#### `npm -v`

While Node
js may come bundled with a particular version of npm, it's the
policy of the CLI team that we recommend all users run `npm@latest` if they
can
 As the CLI is maintained by a small team of contributors, there are
only resources for a single line of development, so npm's own long-term
support releases typically only receive critical security and regression
fixes
 The team believes that the latest tested version of npm is almost
always likely to be the most functional and defect-free version of npm


#### `node -v`

For most users, in most circumstances, the best version of Node will be the
latest long-term support (LTS) release
 Those of you who want access to new
ECMAscript features or bleeding-edge changes to Node's standard library may
be running a newer version, and some may be required to run an older
version of Node because of enterprise change control policies
 That's OK!
But in general, the npm team recommends that most users run Node
js LTS


#### `npm config get registry`

You may be installing from private package registries for your project or
company
 That's great! Others may be following tutorials or StackOverflow
questions in an effort to troubleshoot problems you may be having

Sometimes, this may entail changing the registry you're pointing at
  This
part of `npm doctor` just lets you, and maybe whoever's helping you with
support, know that you're not using the default registry


#### `which git`

While it's documented in the README, it may not be obvious that npm needs
Git installed to do many of the things that it does
 Also, in some cases
– especially on Windows – you may have Git set up in such a way that it's
not accessible via your `PATH` so that npm can find it
 This check ensures
that Git is available


#### Permissions checks

* Your cache must be readable and writable by the user running npm

* Global package binaries must be writable by the user running npm

* Your local `node_modules` path, if you're running `npm doctor` with a
  project directory, must be readable and writable by the user running npm


#### Validate the checksums of cached packages

When an npm package is published, the publishing process generates a
checksum that npm uses at install time to verify that the package didn't
get corrupted in transit
 `npm doctor` uses these checksums to validate the
package tarballs in your local cache (you can see where that cache is
located with `npm config get cache`)
 In the event that there are corrupt
packages in your cache, you should probably run `npm cache clean -f` and
reset the cache


### Configuration

#### `registry`

* Default: ""https://registry
npmjs
org/""
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry

title: npm-edit
section: 1
description: Edit an installed package
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm edit <pkg>[/<subpkg>


]
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

Selects a dependency in the current project and opens the package folder in
the default editor (or whatever you've configured as the npm `editor`
config -- see [`npm-config`](npm-config)
)

After it has been edited, the package is rebuilt so as to pick up any
changes in compiled packages


For instance, you can do `npm install connect` to install connect
into your package, and then `npm edit connect` to make a few
changes to your locally installed copy


### Configuration

#### `editor`

* Default: The EDITOR or VISUAL environment variables, or
  '%SYSTEMROOT%\notepad
exe' on Windows, or 'vi' on Unix systems
* Type: String

The command to run for `npm edit` and `npm config edit`

title: npm-exec
section: 1
description: Run a command from a local or remote npm package
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm exec -- <pkg>[@<version>] [args


]
npm exec --package=<pkg>[@<version>] -- <cmd> [args


]
npm exec -c '<cmd> [args


]'
npm exec --package=foo -c '<cmd> [args


]'

alias: x
```

### Description

This command allows you to run an arbitrary command from an npm package
(either one installed locally, or fetched remotely), in a similar context
as running it via `npm run`


Run without positional arguments or `--call`, this allows you to
interactively run commands in the same sort of shell environment that
`package
json` scripts are run
  Interactive mode is not supported in CI
environments when standard input is a TTY, to prevent hangs


Whatever packages are specified by the `--package` option will be
provided in the `PATH` of the executed command, along with any locally
installed package executables
  The `--package` option may be
specified multiple times, to execute the supplied command in an environment
where all specified packages are available


If any requested packages are not present in the local project
dependencies, then a prompt is printed, which can be suppressed by
providing either `--yes` or `--no`
 The requested packages are
installed to a folder in the npm cache, which is added to the `PATH`
environment variable in the executed process


Package names provided without a specifier will be matched with whatever
version exists in the local project
  Package names with a specifier will
only be considered a match if they have the exact same name and version as
the local dependency


If no `-c` or `--call` option is provided, then the positional arguments
are used to generate the command string
  If no `--package` options
are provided, then npm will attempt to determine the executable name from
the package specifier provided as the first positional argument according
to the following heuristic:

- If the package has a single entry in its `bin` field in `package
json`,
  or if all entries are aliases of the same command, then that command
  will be used

- If the package has multiple `bin` entries, and one of them matches the
  unscoped portion of the `name` field, then that command will be used

- If this does not result in exactly one option (either because there are
  no bin entries, or none of them match the `name` of the package), then
  `npm exec` exits with an error


To run a binary _other than_ the named binary, specify one or more
`--package` options, which will prevent npm from inferring the package from
the first command argument


### `npx` vs `npm exec`

When run via the `npx` binary, all flags and options *must* be set prior to
any positional arguments
  When run via `npm exec`, a double-hyphen `--`
flag can be used to suppress npm's parsing of switches and options that
should be sent to the executed command


For example:

```
$ npx foo@latest bar --package=@npmcli/foo
```

In this case, npm will resolve the `foo` package name, and run the
following command:

```
$ foo bar --package=@npmcli/foo
```

Since the `--package` option comes _after_ the positional arguments, it is
treated as an argument to the executed command


In contrast, due to npm's argument parsing logic, running this command is
different:

```
$ npm exec foo@latest bar --package=@npmcli/foo
```

In this case, npm will parse the `--package` option first, resolving the
`@npmcli/foo` package
  Then, it will execute the following command in that
context:

```
$ foo@latest bar
```

The double-hyphen character is recommended to explicitly tell npm to stop
parsing command line options and switches
  The following command would
thus be equivalent to the `npx` command above:

```
$ npm exec -- foo@latest bar --package=@npmcli/foo
```

### Configuration

#### `package`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

The package or packages to install for [`npm exec`](/commands/npm-exec)



#### `call`

* Default: """"
* Type: String

Optional companion option for `npm exec`, `npx` that allows for specifying a
custom command to be run along with the installed packages


```bash
npm exec --package yo --package generator-node --call ""yo node""
```



#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


### Examples

Run the version of `tap` in the local dependencies, with the provided
arguments:

```
$ npm exec -- tap --bail test/foo
js
$ npx tap --bail test/foo
js
```

Run a command _other than_ the command whose name matches the package name
by specifying a `--package` option:

```
$ npm exec --package=foo -- bar --bar-argument
# ~ or ~
$ npx --package=foo bar --bar-argument
```

Run an arbitrary shell script, in the context of the current project:

```
$ npm x -c 'eslint && say ""hooray, lint passed""'
$ npx -c 'eslint && say ""hooray, lint passed""'
```

### Workspaces support

You may use the [`workspace`](/using-npm/config#workspace) or
[`workspaces`](/using-npm/config#workspaces) configs in order to run an
arbitrary command from an npm package (either one installed locally, or fetched
remotely) in the context of the specified workspaces

If no positional argument or `--call` option is provided, it will open an
interactive subshell in the context of each of these configured workspaces one
at a time


Given a project with configured workspaces, e
g:

```


+-- package
json
`-- packages
   +-- a
   |   `-- package
json
   +-- b
   |   `-- package
json
   `-- c
       `-- package
json
```

Assuming the workspace configuration is properly set up at the root level
`package
json` file
 e
g:

```
{
    ""workspaces"": [ ""
/packages/*"" ]
}
```

You can execute an arbitrary command from a package in the context of each of
the configured workspaces when using the
[`workspaces` config options](/using-npm/config#workspace), in this example
we're using **eslint** to lint any js file found within each workspace folder:

```
npm exec --ws -- eslint 
/*
js
```

#### Filtering workspaces

It's also possible to execute a command in a single workspace using the
`workspace` config along with a name or directory path:

```
npm exec --workspace=a -- eslint 
/*
js
```

The `workspace` config can also be specified multiple times in order to run a
specific script in the context of multiple workspaces
 When defining values for
the `workspace` config in the command line, it also possible to use `-w` as a
shorthand, e
g:

```
npm exec -w a -w b -- eslint 
/*
js
```

This last command will run the `eslint` command in both `
/packages/a` and
`
/packages/b` folders


### Compatibility with Older npx Versions

The `npx` binary was rewritten in npm v7
0
0, and the standalone `npx`
package deprecated at that time
  `npx` uses the `npm exec`
command instead of a separate argument parser and install process, with
some affordances to maintain backwards compatibility with the arguments it
accepted in previous versions


This resulted in some shifts in its functionality:

- Any `npm` config value may be provided

- To prevent security and user-experience problems from mistyping package
  names, `npx` prompts before installing anything
  Suppress this
  prompt with the `-y` or `--yes` option

- The `--no-install` option is deprecated, and will be converted to `--no`

- Shell fallback functionality is removed, as it is not advisable

- The `-p` argument is a shorthand for `--parseable` in npm, but shorthand
  for `--package` in npx
  This is maintained, but only for the `npx`
  executable

- The `--ignore-existing` option is removed
  Locally installed bins are
  always present in the executed process `PATH`

- The `--npm` option is removed
  `npx` will always use the `npm` it ships
  with

- The `--always-spawn` option is redundant, and thus removed

- The `--shell` option is replaced with `--script-shell`, but maintained
  in the `npx` executable for backwards compatibility


### A note on caching

The npm cli utilizes its internal package cache when using the package
name specified
  You can use the following to change how and when the
cli uses this cache
 See [`npm cache`](/commands/npm-cache) for more on
how the cache works


#### prefer-online

Forces staleness checks for packages, making the cli look for updates
immediately even if the package is already in the cache


#### prefer-offline

Bypasses staleness checks for packages
 To force full offline mode, use `offline`


#### offline

Forces full offline mode
 Any packages not locally cached will result in
an error


#### workspace

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result to selecting all of the
  nested workspaces)

This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### workspaces

* Alias: `--ws`
* Type: Boolean
* Default: `false`

Run scripts in the context of all configured workspaces for the current
project

title: npm-explain
section: 1
description: Explain installed packages
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm explain <package-spec>

alias: why
```

### Description

This command will print the chain of dependencies causing a given package
to be installed in the current project


If one or more package specs are provided, then only packages matching
one of the specifiers will have their relationships explained


The package spec can also refer to a folder within `
/node_modules`

For example, running `npm explain glob` within npm's source tree will show:

```bash
glob@7
1
6
node_modules/glob
  glob@""^7
1
4"" from the root project

glob@7
1
1 dev
node_modules/tacks/node_modules/glob
  glob@""^7
0
5"" from rimraf@2
6
2
  node_modules/tacks/node_modules/rimraf
    rimraf@""^2
6
2"" from tacks@1
3
0
    node_modules/tacks
      dev tacks@""^1
3
0"" from the root project
```

To explain just the package residing at a specific folder, pass that as the
argument to the command
  This can be useful when trying to figure out
exactly why a given dependency is being duplicated to satisfy conflicting
version requirements within the project


```bash
$ npm explain node_modules/nyc/node_modules/find-up
find-up@3
0
0 dev
node_modules/nyc/node_modules/find-up
  find-up@""^3
0
0"" from nyc@14
1
1
  node_modules/nyc
    nyc@""^14
1
1"" from tap@14
10
8
    node_modules/tap
      dev tap@""^14
10
8"" from the root project
```

### Configuration
#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output


* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON
parse() before
  saving them to your `package
json`


Not supported by all npm commands




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes

title: npm-explore
section: 1
description: Browse an installed package
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm explore <pkg> [ -- <command>]
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

Spawn a subshell in the directory of the installed package specified


If a command is specified, then it is run in the subshell, which then
immediately terminates


This is particularly handy in the case of git submodules in the
`node_modules` folder:

```bash
npm explore some-dependency -- git pull origin master
```

Note that the package is *not* automatically rebuilt afterwards, so be
sure to use `npm rebuild <pkg>` if you make any changes


### Configuration

#### `shell`

* Default: SHELL environment variable, or ""bash"" on Posix, or ""cmd
exe"" on
  Windows
* Type: String

The shell to run for the `npm explore` command




### See Also

* [npm folders](/configuring-npm/folders)

title: npm-find-dupes
section: 1
description: Find duplication in the package tree
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm find-dupes
```

### Description

Runs `npm dedupe` in `--dry-run` mode, making npm only output the
duplications, without actually changing the package tree


### Configuration

#### `install-strategy`

* Default: ""hoisted""
* Type: ""hoisted"", ""nested"", ""shallow"", or ""linked""

Sets the strategy for installing packages in node_modules
 hoisted
(default): Install non-duplicated in top-level, and duplicated as necessary
within directory structure
 nested: (formerly --legacy-bundling) install in
place, no hoisting
 shallow (formerly --global-style) only install direct
deps at top-level
 linked: (experimental) install in node_modules/
store,
link in place, unhoisted




#### `legacy-bundling`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=nested`

Instead of hoisting package installs in `node_modules`, install packages in
the same manner that they are depended on
 This may cause very deep
directory structures and duplicate package installs as there is no
de-duplicating
 Sets `--install-strategy=nested`




#### `global-style`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=shallow`

Only install direct dependencies in the top level `node_modules`, but hoist
on deeper dependencies
 Sets `--install-strategy=shallow`




#### `strict-peer-deps`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to `true`, and `--legacy-peer-deps` is not set, then _any_
conflicting `peerDependencies` will be treated as an install failure, even
if npm could reasonably guess the appropriate resolution based on non-peer
dependency relationships


By default, conflicting `peerDependencies` deep in the dependency graph will
be resolved using the nearest non-peer dependency specification, even if
doing so will result in some packages receiving a peer dependency outside
the range set in their package's `peerDependencies` object


When such an override is performed, a warning is printed, explaining the
conflict and the packages involved
 If `--strict-peer-deps` is set, then
this warning is treated as a failure




#### `package-lock`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

If set to false, then ignore `package-lock
json` files when installing
 This
will also prevent _writing_ `package-lock
json` if `save` is true




#### `omit`

* Default: 'dev' if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to
  'production', otherwise empty

* Type: ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk


Note that these dependencies _are_ still resolved and added to the
`package-lock
json` or `npm-shrinkwrap
json` file
 They are just not
physically installed on disk


If a package type appears in both the `--include` and `--omit` lists, then
it will be included


If the resulting omit list includes `'dev'`, then the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable will be set to `'production'` for all lifecycle scripts




#### `include`

* Default:
* Type: ""prod"", ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Option that allows for defining which types of dependencies to install


This is the inverse of `--omit=<type>`


Dependency types specified in `--include` will not be omitted, regardless of
the order in which omit/include are specified on the command-line




#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package
json files


Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they
will *not* run any pre- or post-scripts




#### `audit`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When ""true"" submit audit reports alongside the current npm command to the
default registry and all registries configured for scopes
 See the
documentation for [`npm audit`](/commands/npm-audit) for details on what is
submitted




#### `bin-links`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Tells npm to create symlinks (or `
cmd` shims on Windows) for package
executables


Set to false to have it not do this




#### `fund`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When ""true"" displays the message at the end of each `npm install`
acknowledging the number of dependencies looking for funding
 See [`npm
fund`](/commands/npm-fund) for details




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `install-links`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When set file: protocol dependencies will be packed and installed as regular
dependencies instead of creating a symlink
 This option has no effect on
workspaces

title: npm-fund
section: 1
description: Retrieve funding information
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm fund [<package-spec>]
```

### Description

This command retrieves information on how to fund the dependencies of a
given project
 If no package name is provided, it will list all
dependencies that are looking for funding in a tree structure, listing
the type of funding and the url to visit
 If a package name is provided
then it tries to open its funding url using the
[`--browser` config](/using-npm/config#browser) param; if there are multiple
funding sources for the package, the user will be instructed to pass the
`--which` option to disambiguate


The list will avoid duplicated entries and will stack all packages that
share the same url as a single entry
 Thus, the list does not have the
same shape of the output from `npm ls`


#### Example

### Workspaces support

It's possible to filter the results to only include a single workspace
and its dependencies using the
[`workspace` config](/using-npm/config#workspace) option


#### Example:

Here's an example running `npm fund` in a project with a configured
workspace `a`:

```bash
$ npm fund
test-workspaces-fund@1
0
0
+-- https://example
com/a
| | `-- a@1
0
0
| `-- https://example
com/maintainer
|     `-- foo@1
0
0
+-- https://example
com/npmcli-funding
|   `-- @npmcli/test-funding
`-- https://example
com/org
    `-- bar@2
0
0
```

And here is an example of the expected result when filtering only by a
specific workspace `a` in the same project:

```bash
$ npm fund -w a
test-workspaces-fund@1
0
0
`-- https://example
com/a
  | `-- a@1
0
0
  `-- https://example
com/maintainer
      `-- foo@2
0
0
```

### Configuration

#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output


* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON
parse() before
  saving them to your `package
json`


Not supported by all npm commands




#### `browser`

* Default: OS X: `""open""`, Windows: `""start""`, Others: `""xdg-open""`
* Type: null, Boolean, or String

The browser that is called by npm commands to open websites


Set to `false` to suppress browser behavior and instead print urls to
terminal


Set to `true` to use default system URL opener




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `which`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Number

If there are multiple funding sources, which 1-indexed source URL to open

title: npm-help-search
section: 1
description: Search npm help documentation
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm help-search <text>
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

This command will search the npm markdown documentation files for the terms
provided, and then list the results, sorted by relevance


If only one result is found, then it will show that help topic


If the argument to `npm help` is not a known help topic, then it will call
`help-search`
  It is rarely if ever necessary to call this command
directly


### Configuration

#### `long`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Show extended information in `ls`, `search`, and `help-search`




### See Also

* [npm](/commands/npm)
* [npm help](/commands/npm-help)

section: 1
description: Get help on npm
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm help <term> [<terms

>]

alias: hlep
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

If supplied a topic, then show the appropriate documentation page


If the topic does not exist, or if multiple terms are provided, then npm
will run the `help-search` command to find a match
  Note that, if
`help-search` finds a single subject, then it will run `help` on that
topic, so unique matches are equivalent to specifying a topic name


### Configuration

#### `viewer`

* Default: ""man"" on Posix, ""browser"" on Windows
* Type: String

The program to use to view help content


Set to `""browser""` to view html help content in the default web browser

title: npm-hook
section: 1
description: Manage registry hooks
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm hook add <pkg> <url> <secret> [--type=<type>]
npm hook ls [pkg]
npm hook rm <id>
npm hook update <id> <url> <secret>
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

Allows you to manage [npm
hooks](https://blog
npmjs
org/post/145260155635/introducing-hooks-get-notifications-of-npm),
including adding, removing, listing, and updating


Hooks allow you to configure URL endpoints that will be notified whenever a
change happens to any of the supported entity types
 Three different types
of entities can be watched by hooks: packages, owners, and scopes


To create a package hook, simply reference the package name


To create an owner hook, prefix the owner name with `~` (as in,
`~youruser`)


To create a scope hook, prefix the scope name with `@` (as in,
`@yourscope`)


The hook `id` used by `update` and `rm` are the IDs listed in `npm hook ls`
for that particular hook


The shared secret will be sent along to the URL endpoint so you can verify
the request came from your own configured hook


### Example

Add a hook to watch a package for changes:

```bash
$ npm hook add lodash https://example
com/ my-shared-secret
```

Add a hook to watch packages belonging to the user `substack`:

```bash
$ npm hook add ~substack https://example
com/ my-shared-secret
```

Add a hook to watch packages in the scope `@npm`

```bash
$ npm hook add @npm https://example
com/ my-shared-secret
```

List all your active hooks:

```bash
$ npm hook ls
```

List your active hooks for the `lodash` package:

```bash
$ npm hook ls lodash
```

Update an existing hook's url:

```bash
$ npm hook update id-deadbeef https://my-new-website
here/
```

Remove a hook:

```bash
$ npm hook rm id-deadbeef
```

### Configuration

#### `registry`

* Default: ""https://registry
npmjs
org/""
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry




#### `otp`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator
 It's needed
when publishing or changing package permissions with `npm access`


If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time
password, npm will prompt on the command line for one

title: npm-init
section: 1
description: Create a package
json file
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm init <package-spec> (same as `npx <package-spec>`)
npm init <@scope> (same as `npx <@scope>/create`)

aliases: create, innit
```

### Description

`npm init <initializer>` can be used to set up a new or existing npm
package


`initializer` in this case is an npm package named `create-<initializer>`,
which will be installed by [`npm-exec`](/commands/npm-exec), and then have its
main bin executed -- presumably creating or updating `package
json` and
running any other initialization-related operations


The init command is transformed to a corresponding `npm exec` operation as
follows:

* `npm init foo` -> `npm exec create-foo`
* `npm init @usr/foo` -> `npm exec @usr/create-foo`
* `npm init @usr` -> `npm exec @usr/create`
* `npm init @usr@2
0
0` -> `npm exec @usr/create@2
0
0`
* `npm init @usr/foo@2
0
0` -> `npm exec @usr/create-foo@2
0
0`

If the initializer is omitted (by just calling `npm init`), init will fall
back to legacy init behavior
 It will ask you a bunch of questions, and
then write a package
json for you
 It will attempt to make reasonable
guesses based on existing fields, dependencies, and options selected
 It is
strictly additive, so it will keep any fields and values that were already
set
 You can also use `-y`/`--yes` to skip the questionnaire altogether
 If
you pass `--scope`, it will create a scoped package


*Note:* if a user already has the `create-<initializer>` package
globally installed, that will be what `npm init` uses
  If you want npm
to use the latest version, or another specific version you must specify
it:

* `npm init foo@latest` # fetches and runs the latest `create-foo` from
    the registry
* `npm init foo@1
2
3` #  runs `create-foo@1
2
3` specifically

#### Forwarding additional options

Any additional options will be passed directly to the command, so `npm init
foo -- --hello` will map to `npm exec -- create-foo --hello`


To better illustrate how options are forwarded, here's a more evolved
example showing options passed to both the **npm cli** and a create package,
both following commands are equivalent:

- `npm init foo -y --registry=<url> -- --hello -a`
- `npm exec -y --registry=<url> -- create-foo --hello -a`

### Examples

Create a new React-based project using
[`create-react-app`](https://npm
im/create-react-app):

```bash
$ npm init react-app 
/my-react-app
```

Create a new `esm`-compatible package using
[`create-esm`](https://npm
im/create-esm):

```bash
$ mkdir my-esm-lib && cd my-esm-lib
$ npm init esm --yes
```

Generate a plain old package
json using legacy init:

```bash
$ mkdir my-npm-pkg && cd my-npm-pkg
$ git init
$ npm init
```

Generate it without having it ask any questions:

```bash
$ npm init -y
```

### Workspaces support

It's possible to create a new workspace within your project by using the
`workspace` config option
 When using `npm init -w <dir>` the cli will
create the folders and boilerplate expected while also adding a reference
to your project `package
json` `""workspaces"": []` property in order to make
sure that new generated **workspace** is properly set up as such


Given a project with no workspaces, e
g:

```


+-- package
json
```

You may generate a new workspace using the legacy init:

```bash
$ npm init -w packages/a
```

That will generate a new folder and `package
json` file, while also updating
your top-level `package
json` to add the reference to this new workspace:

```


+-- package
json
`-- packages
   `-- a
       `-- package
json
```

The workspaces init also supports the `npm init <initializer> -w <dir>`
syntax, following the same set of rules explained earlier in the initial
**Description** section of this page
 Similar to the previous example of
creating a new React-based project using
[`create-react-app`](https://npm
im/create-react-app), the following syntax
will make sure to create the new react app as a nested **workspace** within your
project and configure your `package
json` to recognize it as such:

```bash
npm init -w packages/my-react-app react-app 
g: `react-app 
`:

```


+-- package
json
`-- packages
   +-- a
   |   `-- package
json
   `-- my-react-app
       +-- README
       +-- package
json
       `-- 



```

### Configuration

#### `init-author-name`

* Default: """"
* Type: String

The value `npm init` should use by default for the package author's name




#### `init-author-url`

* Default: """"
* Type: """" or URL

The value `npm init` should use by default for the package author's
homepage




#### `init-license`

* Default: ""ISC""
* Type: String

The value `npm init` should use by default for the package license




#### `init-module`

* Default: ""~/
npm-init
js""
* Type: Path

A module that will be loaded by the `npm init` command
 See the
documentation for the
[init-package-json](https://github
com/npm/init-package-json) module for
more information, or [npm init](/commands/npm-init)




#### `init-version`

* Default: ""1
0
0""
* Type: SemVer string

The value that `npm init` should use by default for the package version
number, if not already set in package
json




#### `yes`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Automatically answer ""yes"" to any prompts that npm might print on the
command line




#### `force`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Removes various protections against unfortunate side effects, common
mistakes, unnecessary performance degradation, and malicious input


* Allow clobbering non-npm files in global installs

* Allow the `npm version` command to work on an unclean git repository

* Allow deleting the cache folder with `npm cache clean`

* Allow installing packages that have an `engines` declaration requiring a
  different version of npm

* Allow installing packages that have an `engines` declaration requiring a
  different version of `node`, even if `--engine-strict` is enabled

* Allow `npm audit fix` to install modules outside your stated dependency
  range (including SemVer-major changes)

* Allow unpublishing all versions of a published package

* Allow conflicting peerDependencies to be installed in the root project

* Implicitly set `--yes` during `npm init`

* Allow clobbering existing values in `npm pkg`
* Allow unpublishing of entire packages (not just a single version)


If you don't have a clear idea of what you want to do, it is strongly
recommended that you do not use this option!



#### `scope`

* Default: the scope of the current project, if any, or """"
* Type: String

Associate an operation with a scope for a scoped registry


Useful when logging in to or out of a private registry:

```
# log in, linking the scope to the custom registry
npm login --scope=@mycorp --registry=https://registry
mycorp
com

# log out, removing the link and the auth token
npm logout --scope=@mycorp
```

This will cause `@mycorp` to be mapped to the registry for future
installation of packages specified according to the pattern
`@mycorp/package`


This will also cause `npm init` to create a scoped package


```
# accept all defaults, and create a package named ""@foo/whatever"",
# instead of just named ""whatever""
npm init --scope=@foo --yes
```



#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces-update`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

If set to true, the npm cli will run an update after operations that may
possibly change the workspaces installed to the `node_modules` folder




#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes

title: npm-install-ci-test
section: 1
description: Install a project with a clean slate and run tests
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm install-ci-test

aliases: cit, clean-install-test, sit
```

### Description

This command runs `npm ci` followed immediately by `npm test`


### Configuration

#### `install-strategy`

* Default: ""hoisted""
* Type: ""hoisted"", ""nested"", ""shallow"", or ""linked""

Sets the strategy for installing packages in node_modules
 hoisted
(default): Install non-duplicated in top-level, and duplicated as necessary
within directory structure
 nested: (formerly --legacy-bundling) install in
place, no hoisting
 shallow (formerly --global-style) only install direct
deps at top-level
 linked: (experimental) install in node_modules/
store,
link in place, unhoisted




#### `legacy-bundling`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=nested`

Instead of hoisting package installs in `node_modules`, install packages in
the same manner that they are depended on
 This may cause very deep
directory structures and duplicate package installs as there is no
de-duplicating
 Sets `--install-strategy=nested`




#### `global-style`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=shallow`

Only install direct dependencies in the top level `node_modules`, but hoist
on deeper dependencies
 Sets `--install-strategy=shallow`




#### `omit`

* Default: 'dev' if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to
  'production', otherwise empty

* Type: ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk


Note that these dependencies _are_ still resolved and added to the
`package-lock
json` or `npm-shrinkwrap
json` file
 They are just not
physically installed on disk


If a package type appears in both the `--include` and `--omit` lists, then
it will be included


If the resulting omit list includes `'dev'`, then the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable will be set to `'production'` for all lifecycle scripts




#### `include`

* Default:
* Type: ""prod"", ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Option that allows for defining which types of dependencies to install


This is the inverse of `--omit=<type>`


Dependency types specified in `--include` will not be omitted, regardless of
the order in which omit/include are specified on the command-line




#### `strict-peer-deps`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to `true`, and `--legacy-peer-deps` is not set, then _any_
conflicting `peerDependencies` will be treated as an install failure, even
if npm could reasonably guess the appropriate resolution based on non-peer
dependency relationships


By default, conflicting `peerDependencies` deep in the dependency graph will
be resolved using the nearest non-peer dependency specification, even if
doing so will result in some packages receiving a peer dependency outside
the range set in their package's `peerDependencies` object


When such an override is performed, a warning is printed, explaining the
conflict and the packages involved
 If `--strict-peer-deps` is set, then
this warning is treated as a failure




#### `foreground-scripts`

* Default: `false` unless when using `npm pack` or `npm publish` where it
  defaults to `true`
* Type: Boolean

Run all build scripts (ie, `preinstall`, `install`, and `postinstall`)
scripts for installed packages in the foreground process, sharing standard
input, output, and error with the main npm process


Note that this will generally make installs run slower, and be much noisier,
but can be useful for debugging




#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package
json files


Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they
will *not* run any pre- or post-scripts




#### `audit`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When ""true"" submit audit reports alongside the current npm command to the
default registry and all registries configured for scopes
 See the
documentation for [`npm audit`](/commands/npm-audit) for details on what is
submitted




#### `bin-links`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Tells npm to create symlinks (or `
cmd` shims on Windows) for package
executables


Set to false to have it not do this




#### `fund`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When ""true"" displays the message at the end of each `npm install`
acknowledging the number of dependencies looking for funding
 See [`npm
fund`](/commands/npm-fund) for details




#### `dry-run`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done
 This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, `install`, `update`,
`dedupe`, `uninstall`, as well as `pack` and `publish`


Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg `dist-tags`,
`owner`, etc




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `install-links`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When set file: protocol dependencies will be packed and installed as regular
dependencies instead of creating a symlink
 This option has no effect on
workspaces

title: npm-install-test
section: 1
description: Install package(s) and run tests
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm install-test [<package-spec> 


]

alias: it
```

### Description

This command runs an `npm install` followed immediately by an `npm test`
 It
takes exactly the same arguments as `npm install`


### Configuration

#### `save`

* Default: `true` unless when using `npm update` where it defaults to `false`
* Type: Boolean

Save installed packages to a `package
json` file as dependencies


When used with the `npm rm` command, removes the dependency from
`package
json`


Will also prevent writing to `package-lock
json` if set to `false`




#### `save-exact`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Dependencies saved to package
json will be configured with an exact version
rather than using npm's default semver range operator




#### `global`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Operates in ""global"" mode, so that packages are installed into the `prefix`
folder instead of the current working directory
 See
[folders](/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior


* packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead
  of the current working directory

* bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
* man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`



#### `install-strategy`

* Default: ""hoisted""
* Type: ""hoisted"", ""nested"", ""shallow"", or ""linked""

Sets the strategy for installing packages in node_modules
 hoisted
(default): Install non-duplicated in top-level, and duplicated as necessary
within directory structure
 nested: (formerly --legacy-bundling) install in
place, no hoisting
 shallow (formerly --global-style) only install direct
deps at top-level
 linked: (experimental) install in node_modules/
store,
link in place, unhoisted




#### `legacy-bundling`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=nested`

Instead of hoisting package installs in `node_modules`, install packages in
the same manner that they are depended on
 This may cause very deep
directory structures and duplicate package installs as there is no
de-duplicating
 Sets `--install-strategy=nested`




#### `global-style`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=shallow`

Only install direct dependencies in the top level `node_modules`, but hoist
on deeper dependencies
 Sets `--install-strategy=shallow`




#### `omit`

* Default: 'dev' if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to
  'production', otherwise empty

* Type: ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk


Note that these dependencies _are_ still resolved and added to the
`package-lock
json` or `npm-shrinkwrap
json` file
 They are just not
physically installed on disk


If a package type appears in both the `--include` and `--omit` lists, then
it will be included


If the resulting omit list includes `'dev'`, then the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable will be set to `'production'` for all lifecycle scripts




#### `include`

* Default:
* Type: ""prod"", ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Option that allows for defining which types of dependencies to install


This is the inverse of `--omit=<type>`


Dependency types specified in `--include` will not be omitted, regardless of
the order in which omit/include are specified on the command-line




#### `strict-peer-deps`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to `true`, and `--legacy-peer-deps` is not set, then _any_
conflicting `peerDependencies` will be treated as an install failure, even
if npm could reasonably guess the appropriate resolution based on non-peer
dependency relationships


By default, conflicting `peerDependencies` deep in the dependency graph will
be resolved using the nearest non-peer dependency specification, even if
doing so will result in some packages receiving a peer dependency outside
the range set in their package's `peerDependencies` object


When such an override is performed, a warning is printed, explaining the
conflict and the packages involved
 If `--strict-peer-deps` is set, then
this warning is treated as a failure




#### `prefer-dedupe`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Prefer to deduplicate packages if possible, rather than choosing a newer
version of a dependency




#### `package-lock`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

If set to false, then ignore `package-lock
json` files when installing
 This
will also prevent _writing_ `package-lock
json` if `save` is true




#### `package-lock-only`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to true, the current operation will only use the `package-lock
json`,
ignoring `node_modules`


For `update` this means only the `package-lock
json` will be updated,
instead of checking `node_modules` and downloading dependencies


For `list` this means the output will be based on the tree described by the
`package-lock
json`, rather than the contents of `node_modules`




#### `foreground-scripts`

* Default: `false` unless when using `npm pack` or `npm publish` where it
  defaults to `true`
* Type: Boolean

Run all build scripts (ie, `preinstall`, `install`, and `postinstall`)
scripts for installed packages in the foreground process, sharing standard
input, output, and error with the main npm process


Note that this will generally make installs run slower, and be much noisier,
but can be useful for debugging




#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package
json files


Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they
will *not* run any pre- or post-scripts




#### `audit`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When ""true"" submit audit reports alongside the current npm command to the
default registry and all registries configured for scopes
 See the
documentation for [`npm audit`](/commands/npm-audit) for details on what is
submitted




#### `bin-links`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Tells npm to create symlinks (or `
cmd` shims on Windows) for package
executables


Set to false to have it not do this




#### `fund`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When ""true"" displays the message at the end of each `npm install`
acknowledging the number of dependencies looking for funding
 See [`npm
fund`](/commands/npm-fund) for details




#### `dry-run`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done
 This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, `install`, `update`,
`dedupe`, `uninstall`, as well as `pack` and `publish`


Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg `dist-tags`,
`owner`, etc




#### `cpu`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

Override CPU architecture of native modules to install
 Acceptable values
are same as `cpu` field of package
json, which comes from `process
arch`




#### `os`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

Override OS of native modules to install
 Acceptable values are same as `os`
field of package
json, which comes from `process
platform`




#### `libc`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

Override libc of native modules to install
 Acceptable values are same as
`libc` field of package
json



#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `install-links`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When set file: protocol dependencies will be packed and installed as regular
dependencies instead of creating a symlink
 This option has no effect on
workspaces

title: npm-install
section: 1
description: Install a package
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm install [<package-spec> 


]

aliases: add, i, in, ins, inst, insta, instal, isnt, isnta, isntal, isntall
```

### Description

This command installs a package and any packages that it depends on
 If the
package has a package-lock, or an npm shrinkwrap file, or a yarn lock file,
the installation of dependencies will be driven by that, respecting the
following order of precedence:

* `npm-shrinkwrap
json`
* `package-lock
json`
* `yarn
lock`

See [package-lock
json](/configuring-npm/package-lock-json) and
[`npm shrinkwrap`](/commands/npm-shrinkwrap)


A `package` is:

* a) a folder containing a program described by a
  [`package
json`](/configuring-npm/package-json) file
* b) a gzipped tarball containing (a)
* c) a url that resolves to (b)
* d) a `<name>@<version>` that is published on the registry (see
  [`registry`](/using-npm/registry)) with (c)
* e) a `<name>@<tag>` (see [`npm dist-tag`](/commands/npm-dist-tag)) that
  points to (d)
* f) a `<name>` that has a ""latest"" tag satisfying (e)
* g) a `<git remote url>` that resolves to (a)

Even if you never publish your package, you can still get a lot of benefits
of using npm if you just want to write a node program (a), and perhaps if
you also want to be able to easily install it elsewhere after packing it up
into a tarball (b)



* `npm install` (in a package directory, no arguments):

    Install the dependencies to the local `node_modules` folder


    In global mode (ie, with `-g` or `--global` appended to the command),
    it installs the current package context (ie, the current working
    directory) as a global package


    By default, `npm install` will install all modules listed as
    dependencies in [`package
json`](/configuring-npm/package-json)


    With the `--production` flag (or when the `NODE_ENV` environment
    variable is set to `production`), npm will not install modules listed
    in `devDependencies`
 To install all modules listed in both
    `dependencies` and `devDependencies` when `NODE_ENV` environment
    variable is set to `production`, you can use `--production=false`


    > NOTE: The `--production` flag has no particular meaning when adding a
    dependency to a project


* `npm install <folder>`:

    If `<folder>` sits inside the root of your project, its dependencies will be installed and may
    be hoisted to the top-level `node_modules` as they would for other
    types of dependencies
 If `<folder>` sits outside the root of your project,
    *npm will not install the package dependencies* in the directory `<folder>`,
    but it will create a symlink to `<folder>`


    > NOTE: If you want to install the content of a directory like a package from the registry instead of creating a link, you would need to use the `--install-links` option


    Example:

    ```bash
    npm install 

/

/other-package --install-links
    npm install 
/sub-package
    ```

* `npm install <tarball file>`:

    Install a package that is sitting on the filesystem
  Note: if you just
    want to link a dev directory into your npm root, you can do this more
    easily by using [`npm link`](/commands/npm-link)


    Tarball requirements:
    * The filename *must* use `
tar`, `
tar
gz`, or `
tgz` as the
      extension

    * The package contents should reside in a subfolder inside the tarball
      (usually it is called `package/`)
 npm strips one directory layer
      when installing the package (an equivalent of `tar x
      --strip-components=1` is run)

    * The package must contain a `package
json` file with `name` and
      `version` properties


    Example:

    ```bash
    npm install 
/package
tgz
    ```

* `npm install <tarball url>`:

    Fetch the tarball url, and then install it
  In order to distinguish between
    this and other options, the argument must start with ""http://"" or ""https://""

    Example:

    ```bash
    npm install https://github
com/indexzero/forever/tarball/v0
5
6
    ```

* `npm install [<@scope>/]<name>`:

    Do a `<name>@<tag>` install, where `<tag>` is the ""tag"" config
 (See
    [`config`](/using-npm/config#tag)
 The config's default value is `latest`
)

    In most cases, this will install the version of the modules tagged as
    `latest` on the npm registry


    Example:

    ```bash
    npm install sax
    ```

    `npm install` saves any specified packages into `dependencies` by default

    Additionally, you can control where and how they get saved with some
    additional flags:

    * `-P, --save-prod`: Package will appear in your `dependencies`
 This
      is the default unless `-D` or `-O` are present


    * `-D, --save-dev`: Package will appear in your `devDependencies`


    * `-O, --save-optional`: Package will appear in your
      `optionalDependencies`


    * `--no-save`: Prevents saving to `dependencies`


    When using any of the above options to save dependencies to your
    package
json, there are two additional, optional flags:

    * `-E, --save-exact`: Saved dependencies will be configured with an
      exact version rather than using npm's default semver range operator


    * `-B, --save-bundle`: Saved dependencies will also be added to your
      `bundleDependencies` list


    Further, if you have an `npm-shrinkwrap
json` or `package-lock
json`
    then it will be updated as well


    `<scope>` is optional
 The package will be downloaded from the registry
    associated with the specified scope
 If no registry is associated with
    the given scope the default registry is assumed
 See
    [`scope`](/using-npm/scope)


    Note: if you do not include the @-symbol on your scope name, npm will
    interpret this as a GitHub repository instead, see below
 Scopes names
    must also be followed by a slash


    Examples:

    ```bash
    npm install sax
    npm install githubname/reponame
    npm install @myorg/privatepackage
    npm install node-tap --save-dev
    npm install dtrace-provider --save-optional
    npm install readable-stream --save-exact
    npm install ansi-regex --save-bundle
    ```

    **Note**: If there is a file or folder named `<name>` in the current
    working directory, then it will try to install that, and only try to
    fetch the package by name if it is not valid


* `npm install <alias>@npm:<name>`:

    Install a package under a custom alias
 Allows multiple versions of
    a same-name package side-by-side, more convenient import names for
    packages with otherwise long ones, and using git forks replacements
    or forked npm packages as replacements
 Aliasing works only on your
    project and does not rename packages in transitive dependencies

    Aliases should follow the naming conventions stated in
    [`validate-npm-package-name`](https://www
npmjs
com/package/validate-npm-package-name#naming-rules)


    Examples:

    ```bash
    npm install my-react@npm:react
    npm install jquery2@npm:jquery@2
    npm install jquery3@npm:jquery@3
    npm install npa@npm:npm-package-arg
    ```

* `npm install [<@scope>/]<name>@<tag>`:

    Install the version of the package that is referenced by the specified tag

    If the tag does not exist in the registry data for that package, then this
    will fail


    Example:

    ```bash
    npm install sax@latest
    npm install @myorg/mypackage@latest
    ```

* `npm install [<@scope>/]<name>@<version>`:

    Install the specified version of the package
  This will fail if the
    version has not been published to the registry


    Example:

    ```bash
    npm install sax@0
1
1
    npm install @myorg/privatepackage@1
5
0
    ```

* `npm install [<@scope>/]<name>@<version range>`:

    Install a version of the package matching the specified version range

    This will follow the same rules for resolving dependencies described in
    [`package
json`](/configuring-npm/package-json)


    Note that most version ranges must be put in quotes so that your shell
    will treat it as a single argument


    Example:

    ```bash
    npm install sax@"">=0
1
0 <0
2
0""
    npm install @myorg/privatepackage@""16 - 17""
    ```

* `npm install <git remote url>`:

    Installs the package from the hosted git provider, cloning it with
    `git`
  For a full git remote url, only that URL will be attempted


    ```bash
    <protocol>://[<user>[:<password>]@]<hostname>[:<port>][:][/]<path>[#<commit-ish> | #semver:<semver>]
    ```

    `<protocol>` is one of `git`, `git+ssh`, `git+http`, `git+https`, or
    `git+file`


    If `#<commit-ish>` is provided, it will be used to clone exactly that
    commit
 If the commit-ish has the format `#semver:<semver>`, `<semver>`
    can be any valid semver range or exact version, and npm will look for
    any tags or refs matching that range in the remote repository, much as
    it would for a registry dependency
 If neither `#<commit-ish>` or
    `#semver:<semver>` is specified, then the default branch of the
    repository is used


    If the repository makes use of submodules, those submodules will be
    cloned as well


    If the package being installed contains a `prepare` script, its
    `dependencies` and `devDependencies` will be installed, and the prepare
    script will be run, before the package is packaged and installed


    The following git environment variables are recognized by npm and will
    be added to the environment when running git:

    * `GIT_ASKPASS`
    * `GIT_EXEC_PATH`
    * `GIT_PROXY_COMMAND`
    * `GIT_SSH`
    * `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`
    * `GIT_SSL_CAINFO`
    * `GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY`

    See the git man page for details


    Examples:

    ```bash
    npm install git+ssh://git@github
com:npm/cli
git#v1
0
27
    npm install git+ssh://git@github
com:npm/cli#pull/273
    npm install git+ssh://git@github
com:npm/cli#semver:^5
0
    npm install git+https://isaacs@github
com/npm/cli
git
    npm install git://github
com/npm/cli
git#v1
0
27
    GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i ~/
ssh/custom_ident' npm install git+ssh://git@github
com:npm/cli
git
    ```

* `npm install <githubname>/<githubrepo>[#<commit-ish>]`:
* `npm install github:<githubname>/<githubrepo>[#<commit-ish>]`:

    Install the package at `https://github
com/githubname/githubrepo` by
    attempting to clone it using `git`


    If `#<commit-ish>` is provided, it will be used to clone exactly that
    commit
 If the commit-ish has the format `#semver:<semver>`, `<semver>`
    can be any valid semver range or exact version, and npm will look for
    any tags or refs matching that range in the remote repository, much as
    it would for a registry dependency
 If neither `#<commit-ish>` or
    `#semver:<semver>` is specified, then the default branch is used


    As with regular git dependencies, `dependencies` and `devDependencies`
    will be installed if the package has a `prepare` script before the
    package is done installing


    Examples:

    ```bash
    npm install mygithubuser/myproject
    npm install github:mygithubuser/myproject
   ```

* `npm install gist:[<githubname>/]<gistID>[#<commit-ish>|#semver:<semver>]`:

    Install the package at `https://gist
github
com/gistID` by attempting to
    clone it using `git`
 The GitHub username associated with the gist is
    optional and will not be saved in `package
json`


    As with regular git dependencies, `dependencies` and `devDependencies` will
    be installed if the package has a `prepare` script before the package is
    done installing


    Example:

    ```bash
    npm install gist:101a11beef
    ```

* `npm install bitbucket:<bitbucketname>/<bitbucketrepo>[#<commit-ish>]`:

    Install the package at `https://bitbucket
org/bitbucketname/bitbucketrepo`
    by attempting to clone it using `git`


    If `#<commit-ish>` is provided, it will be used to clone exactly that
    commit
 If the commit-ish has the format `#semver:<semver>`, `<semver>` can
    be any valid semver range or exact version, and npm will look for any tags
    or refs matching that range in the remote repository, much as it would for a
    registry dependency
 If neither `#<commit-ish>` or `#semver:<semver>` is
    specified, then `master` is used


    As with regular git dependencies, `dependencies` and `devDependencies` will
    be installed if the package has a `prepare` script before the package is
    done installing


    Example:

    ```bash
    npm install bitbucket:mybitbucketuser/myproject
    ```

* `npm install gitlab:<gitlabname>/<gitlabrepo>[#<commit-ish>]`:

    Install the package at `https://gitlab
com/gitlabname/gitlabrepo`
    by attempting to clone it using `git`


    If `#<commit-ish>` is provided, it will be used to clone exactly that
    commit
 If the commit-ish has the format `#semver:<semver>`, `<semver>` can
    be any valid semver range or exact version, and npm will look for any tags
    or refs matching that range in the remote repository, much as it would for a
    registry dependency
 If neither `#<commit-ish>` or `#semver:<semver>` is
    specified, then `master` is used


    As with regular git dependencies, `dependencies` and `devDependencies` will
    be installed if the package has a `prepare` script before the package is
    done installing


    Example:

    ```bash
    npm install gitlab:mygitlabuser/myproject
    npm install gitlab:myusr/myproj#semver:^5
0
    ```

You may combine multiple arguments and even multiple types of arguments

For example:

```bash
npm install sax@"">=0
1
0 <0
2
0"" bench supervisor
```

The `--tag` argument will apply to all of the specified install targets
 If
a tag with the given name exists, the tagged version is preferred over
newer versions


The `--dry-run` argument will report in the usual way what the install
would have done without actually installing anything


The `--package-lock-only` argument will only update the
`package-lock
json`, instead of checking `node_modules` and downloading
dependencies


The `-f` or `--force` argument will force npm to fetch remote resources
even if a local copy exists on disk


```bash
npm install sax --force
```

### Configuration

See the [`config`](/using-npm/config) help doc
  Many of the configuration
params have some effect on installation, since that's most of what npm
does


These are some of the most common options related to installation


#### `save`

* Default: `true` unless when using `npm update` where it defaults to `false`
* Type: Boolean

Save installed packages to a `package
json` file as dependencies


When used with the `npm rm` command, removes the dependency from
`package
json`


Will also prevent writing to `package-lock
json` if set to `false`




#### `save-exact`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Dependencies saved to package
json will be configured with an exact version
rather than using npm's default semver range operator




#### `global`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Operates in ""global"" mode, so that packages are installed into the `prefix`
folder instead of the current working directory
 See
[folders](/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior


* packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead
  of the current working directory

* bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
* man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`



#### `install-strategy`

* Default: ""hoisted""
* Type: ""hoisted"", ""nested"", ""shallow"", or ""linked""

Sets the strategy for installing packages in node_modules
 hoisted
(default): Install non-duplicated in top-level, and duplicated as necessary
within directory structure
 nested: (formerly --legacy-bundling) install in
place, no hoisting
 shallow (formerly --global-style) only install direct
deps at top-level
 linked: (experimental) install in node_modules/
store,
link in place, unhoisted




#### `legacy-bundling`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=nested`

Instead of hoisting package installs in `node_modules`, install packages in
the same manner that they are depended on
 This may cause very deep
directory structures and duplicate package installs as there is no
de-duplicating
 Sets `--install-strategy=nested`




#### `global-style`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=shallow`

Only install direct dependencies in the top level `node_modules`, but hoist
on deeper dependencies
 Sets `--install-strategy=shallow`




#### `omit`

* Default: 'dev' if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to
  'production', otherwise empty

* Type: ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk


Note that these dependencies _are_ still resolved and added to the
`package-lock
json` or `npm-shrinkwrap
json` file
 They are just not
physically installed on disk


If a package type appears in both the `--include` and `--omit` lists, then
it will be included


If the resulting omit list includes `'dev'`, then the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable will be set to `'production'` for all lifecycle scripts




#### `include`

* Default:
* Type: ""prod"", ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Option that allows for defining which types of dependencies to install


This is the inverse of `--omit=<type>`


Dependency types specified in `--include` will not be omitted, regardless of
the order in which omit/include are specified on the command-line




#### `strict-peer-deps`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to `true`, and `--legacy-peer-deps` is not set, then _any_
conflicting `peerDependencies` will be treated as an install failure, even
if npm could reasonably guess the appropriate resolution based on non-peer
dependency relationships


By default, conflicting `peerDependencies` deep in the dependency graph will
be resolved using the nearest non-peer dependency specification, even if
doing so will result in some packages receiving a peer dependency outside
the range set in their package's `peerDependencies` object


When such an override is performed, a warning is printed, explaining the
conflict and the packages involved
 If `--strict-peer-deps` is set, then
this warning is treated as a failure




#### `prefer-dedupe`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Prefer to deduplicate packages if possible, rather than choosing a newer
version of a dependency




#### `package-lock`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

If set to false, then ignore `package-lock
json` files when installing
 This
will also prevent _writing_ `package-lock
json` if `save` is true




#### `package-lock-only`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to true, the current operation will only use the `package-lock
json`,
ignoring `node_modules`


For `update` this means only the `package-lock
json` will be updated,
instead of checking `node_modules` and downloading dependencies


For `list` this means the output will be based on the tree described by the
`package-lock
json`, rather than the contents of `node_modules`




#### `foreground-scripts`

* Default: `false` unless when using `npm pack` or `npm publish` where it
  defaults to `true`
* Type: Boolean

Run all build scripts (ie, `preinstall`, `install`, and `postinstall`)
scripts for installed packages in the foreground process, sharing standard
input, output, and error with the main npm process


Note that this will generally make installs run slower, and be much noisier,
but can be useful for debugging




#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package
json files


Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they
will *not* run any pre- or post-scripts




#### `audit`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When ""true"" submit audit reports alongside the current npm command to the
default registry and all registries configured for scopes
 See the
documentation for [`npm audit`](/commands/npm-audit) for details on what is
submitted




#### `bin-links`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Tells npm to create symlinks (or `
cmd` shims on Windows) for package
executables


Set to false to have it not do this




#### `fund`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When ""true"" displays the message at the end of each `npm install`
acknowledging the number of dependencies looking for funding
 See [`npm
fund`](/commands/npm-fund) for details




#### `dry-run`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done
 This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, `install`, `update`,
`dedupe`, `uninstall`, as well as `pack` and `publish`


Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg `dist-tags`,
`owner`, etc




#### `cpu`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

Override CPU architecture of native modules to install
 Acceptable values
are same as `cpu` field of package
json, which comes from `process
arch`




#### `os`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

Override OS of native modules to install
 Acceptable values are same as `os`
field of package
json, which comes from `process
platform`




#### `libc`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

Override libc of native modules to install
 Acceptable values are same as
`libc` field of package
json



#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `install-links`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When set file: protocol dependencies will be packed and installed as regular
dependencies instead of creating a symlink
 This option has no effect on
workspaces




### Algorithm

Given a `package{dep}` structure: `A{B,C}, B{C}, C{D}`,
the npm install algorithm produces:

```bash
A
+-- B
+-- C
+-- D
```

That is, the dependency from B to C is satisfied by the fact that A already
caused C to be installed at a higher level
 D is still installed at the top
level because nothing conflicts with it


For `A{B,C}, B{C,D@1}, C{D@2}`, this algorithm produces:

```bash
A
+-- B
+-- C
   `-- D@2
+-- D@1
```

Because B's D@1 will be installed in the top-level, C now has to install
D@2 privately for itself
 This algorithm is deterministic, but different
trees may be produced if two dependencies are requested for installation in
a different order

the specific folder structures that npm creates

title: npm-link
section: 1
description: Symlink a package folder
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm link [<package-spec>]

alias: ln
```

### Description

This is handy for installing your own stuff, so that you can work on it and
test iteratively without having to continually rebuild


Package linking is a two-step process


First, `npm link` in a package folder with no arguments will create a
symlink in the global folder `{prefix}/lib/node_modules/<package>` that
links to the package where the `npm link` command was executed
 It will
also link any bins in the package to `{prefix}/bin/{name}`
  Note that
`npm link` uses the global prefix (see `npm prefix -g` for its value)


Next, in some other location, `npm link package-name` will create a
symbolic link from globally-installed `package-name` to `node_modules/` of
the current folder


Note that `package-name` is taken from `package
json`, _not_ from the
directory name


The package name can be optionally prefixed with a scope
 See
[`scope`](/using-npm/scope)
  The scope must be preceded by an @-symbol and
followed by a slash


When creating tarballs for `npm publish`, the linked packages are
""snapshotted"" to their current state by resolving the symbolic links, if
they are included in `bundleDependencies`


For example:

```bash
cd ~/projects/node-redis    # go into the package directory
npm link                    # creates global link
cd ~/projects/node-bloggy   # go into some other package directory

npm link redis              # link-install the package
```

Now, any changes to `~/projects/node-redis` will be reflected in
`~/projects/node-bloggy/node_modules/node-redis/`
 Note that the link
should be to the package name, not the directory name for that package


You may also shortcut the two steps in one
  For example, to do the
above use-case in a shorter way:

```bash
cd ~/projects/node-bloggy  # go into the dir of your main project
npm link 

/node-redis     # link the dir of your dependency
```

The second line is the equivalent of doing:

```bash
(cd 

/node-redis; npm link)
npm link redis
```

That is, it first creates a global link, and then links the global
installation target into your project's `node_modules` folder


Note that in this case, you are referring to the directory name,
`node-redis`, rather than the package name `redis`


If your linked package is scoped (see [`scope`](/using-npm/scope)) your
link command must include that scope, e
g


```bash
npm link @myorg/privatepackage
```

### Caveat

Note that package dependencies linked in this way are _not_ saved to
`package
json` by default, on the assumption that the intention is to have
a link stand in for a regular non-link dependency
  Otherwise, for example,
if you depend on `redis@^3
0
1`, and ran `npm link redis`, it would replace
the `^3
0
1` dependency with `file:

/path/to/node-redis`, which you
probably don't want!  Additionally, other users or developers on your
project would run into issues if they do not have their folders set up
exactly the same as yours


If you are adding a _new_ dependency as a link, you should add it to the
relevant metadata by running `npm install <dep> --package-lock-only`


If you _want_ to save the `file:` reference in your `package
json` and
`package-lock
json` files, you can use `npm link <dep> --save` to do so


### Workspace Usage

`npm link <pkg> --workspace <name>` will link the relevant package as a
dependency of the specified workspace(s)
  Note that It may actually be
linked into the parent project's `node_modules` folder, if there are no
conflicting dependencies


`npm link --workspace <name>` will create a global link to the specified
workspace(s)


### Configuration

#### `save`

* Default: `true` unless when using `npm update` where it defaults to `false`
* Type: Boolean

Save installed packages to a `package
json` file as dependencies


When used with the `npm rm` command, removes the dependency from
`package
json`


Will also prevent writing to `package-lock
json` if set to `false`




#### `save-exact`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Dependencies saved to package
json will be configured with an exact version
rather than using npm's default semver range operator




#### `global`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Operates in ""global"" mode, so that packages are installed into the `prefix`
folder instead of the current working directory
 See
[folders](/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior


* packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead
  of the current working directory

* bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
* man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`



#### `install-strategy`

* Default: ""hoisted""
* Type: ""hoisted"", ""nested"", ""shallow"", or ""linked""

Sets the strategy for installing packages in node_modules
 hoisted
(default): Install non-duplicated in top-level, and duplicated as necessary
within directory structure
 nested: (formerly --legacy-bundling) install in
place, no hoisting
 shallow (formerly --global-style) only install direct
deps at top-level
 linked: (experimental) install in node_modules/
store,
link in place, unhoisted




#### `legacy-bundling`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=nested`

Instead of hoisting package installs in `node_modules`, install packages in
the same manner that they are depended on
 This may cause very deep
directory structures and duplicate package installs as there is no
de-duplicating
 Sets `--install-strategy=nested`




#### `global-style`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=shallow`

Only install direct dependencies in the top level `node_modules`, but hoist
on deeper dependencies
 Sets `--install-strategy=shallow`




#### `strict-peer-deps`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to `true`, and `--legacy-peer-deps` is not set, then _any_
conflicting `peerDependencies` will be treated as an install failure, even
if npm could reasonably guess the appropriate resolution based on non-peer
dependency relationships


By default, conflicting `peerDependencies` deep in the dependency graph will
be resolved using the nearest non-peer dependency specification, even if
doing so will result in some packages receiving a peer dependency outside
the range set in their package's `peerDependencies` object


When such an override is performed, a warning is printed, explaining the
conflict and the packages involved
 If `--strict-peer-deps` is set, then
this warning is treated as a failure




#### `package-lock`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

If set to false, then ignore `package-lock
json` files when installing
 This
will also prevent _writing_ `package-lock
json` if `save` is true




#### `omit`

* Default: 'dev' if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to
  'production', otherwise empty

* Type: ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk


Note that these dependencies _are_ still resolved and added to the
`package-lock
json` or `npm-shrinkwrap
json` file
 They are just not
physically installed on disk


If a package type appears in both the `--include` and `--omit` lists, then
it will be included


If the resulting omit list includes `'dev'`, then the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable will be set to `'production'` for all lifecycle scripts




#### `include`

* Default:
* Type: ""prod"", ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Option that allows for defining which types of dependencies to install


This is the inverse of `--omit=<type>`


Dependency types specified in `--include` will not be omitted, regardless of
the order in which omit/include are specified on the command-line




#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package
json files


Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they
will *not* run any pre- or post-scripts




#### `audit`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When ""true"" submit audit reports alongside the current npm command to the
default registry and all registries configured for scopes
 See the
documentation for [`npm audit`](/commands/npm-audit) for details on what is
submitted




#### `bin-links`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Tells npm to create symlinks (or `
cmd` shims on Windows) for package
executables


Set to false to have it not do this




#### `fund`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When ""true"" displays the message at the end of each `npm install`
acknowledging the number of dependencies looking for funding
 See [`npm
fund`](/commands/npm-fund) for details




#### `dry-run`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done
 This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, `install`, `update`,
`dedupe`, `uninstall`, as well as `pack` and `publish`


Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg `dist-tags`,
`owner`, etc




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `install-links`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When set file: protocol dependencies will be packed and installed as regular
dependencies instead of creating a symlink
 This option has no effect on
workspaces

title: npm-login
section: 1
description: Login to a registry user account
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm login
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

Verify a user in the specified registry, and save the credentials to the
`
npmrc` file
 If no registry is specified, the default registry will be
used (see [`config`](/using-npm/config))


When using `legacy` for your `auth-type`, the username and password, are
read in from prompts


To reset your password, go to <https://www
npmjs
com/forgot>

To change your email address, go to <https://www
npmjs
com/email-edit>

You may use this command multiple times with the same user account to
authorize on a new machine
  When authenticating on a new machine,
the username, password and email address must all match with
your existing record


### Configuration

#### `registry`

* Default: ""https://registry
npmjs
org/""
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry




#### `scope`

* Default: the scope of the current project, if any, or """"
* Type: String

Associate an operation with a scope for a scoped registry


Useful when logging in to or out of a private registry:

```
# log in, linking the scope to the custom registry
npm login --scope=@mycorp --registry=https://registry
mycorp
com

# log out, removing the link and the auth token
npm logout --scope=@mycorp
```

This will cause `@mycorp` to be mapped to the registry for future
installation of packages specified according to the pattern
`@mycorp/package`


This will also cause `npm init` to create a scoped package


```
# accept all defaults, and create a package named ""@foo/whatever"",
# instead of just named ""whatever""
npm init --scope=@foo --yes
```



#### `auth-type`

* Default: ""web""
* Type: ""legacy"" or ""web""

What authentication strategy to use with `login`
 Note that if an `otp`
config is given, this value will always be set to `legacy`

---
title: npm-logout
section: 1
description: Log out of the registry
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm logout
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

When logged into a registry that supports token-based authentication, tell
the server to end this token's session
 This will invalidate the token
everywhere you're using it, not just for the current environment


When logged into a legacy registry that uses username and password
authentication, this will clear the credentials in your user configuration

In this case, it will _only_ affect the current environment


If `--scope` is provided, this will find the credentials for the registry
connected to that scope, if set


### Configuration

#### `registry`

* Default: ""https://registry
npmjs
org/""
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry




#### `scope`

* Default: the scope of the current project, if any, or """"
* Type: String

Associate an operation with a scope for a scoped registry


Useful when logging in to or out of a private registry:

```
# log in, linking the scope to the custom registry
npm login --scope=@mycorp --registry=https://registry
mycorp
com

# log out, removing the link and the auth token
npm logout --scope=@mycorp
```

This will cause `@mycorp` to be mapped to the registry for future
installation of packages specified according to the pattern
`@mycorp/package`


This will also cause `npm init` to create a scoped package


```
# accept all defaults, and create a package named ""@foo/whatever"",
# instead of just named ""whatever""
npm init --scope=@foo --yes
```

title: npm-ls
section: 1
description: List installed packages
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm ls <package-spec>

alias: list
```

### Description

This command will print to stdout all the versions of packages that are
installed, as well as their dependencies when `--all` is specified, in a
tree structure


Note: to get a ""bottoms up"" view of why a given package is included in the
tree at all, use [`npm explain`](/commands/npm-explain)


Positional arguments are `name@version-range` identifiers, which will limit
the results to only the paths to the packages named
  Note that nested
packages will *also* show the paths to the specified packages
  For
example, running `npm ls promzard` in npm's source tree will show:

```bash
npm@10
5
2 /path/to/npm
└─┬ init-package-json@0
0
4
  └── promzard@0
1
5
```

It will print out extraneous, missing, and invalid packages


If a project specifies git urls for dependencies these are shown
in parentheses after the `name@version` to make it easier for users to
recognize potential forks of a project


The tree shown is the logical dependency tree, based on package
dependencies, not the physical layout of your `node_modules` folder


When run as `ll` or `la`, it shows extended information by default


### Note: Design Changes Pending

The `npm ls` command's output and behavior made a _ton_ of sense when npm
created a `node_modules` folder that naively nested every dependency
  In
such a case, the logical dependency graph and physical tree of packages on
disk would be roughly identical


With the advent of automatic install-time deduplication of dependencies in
npm v3, the `ls` output was modified to display the logical dependency
graph as a tree structure, since this was more useful to most users

However, without using `npm ls -l`, it became impossible to show _where_ a
package was actually installed much of the time!

With the advent of automatic installation of `peerDependencies` in npm v7,
this gets even more curious, as `peerDependencies` are logically
""underneath"" their dependents in the dependency graph, but are always
physically at or above their location on disk


Also, in the years since npm got an `ls` command (in version 0
0
2!),
dependency graphs have gotten much larger as a general rule
  Therefore, in
order to avoid dumping an excessive amount of content to the terminal, `npm
ls` now only shows the _top_ level dependencies, unless `--all` is
provided


A thorough re-examination of the use cases, intention, behavior, and output
of this command, is currently underway
  Expect significant changes to at
least the default human-readable `npm ls` output in npm v8


### Configuration

#### `all`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When running `npm outdated` and `npm ls`, setting `--all` will show all
outdated or installed packages, rather than only those directly depended
upon by the current project




#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output


* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON
parse() before
  saving them to your `package
json`


Not supported by all npm commands




#### `long`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Show extended information in `ls`, `search`, and `help-search`




#### `parseable`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Output parseable results from commands that write to standard output
 For
`npm search`, this will be tab-separated table format




#### `global`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Operates in ""global"" mode, so that packages are installed into the `prefix`
folder instead of the current working directory
 See
[folders](/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior


* packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead
  of the current working directory

* bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
* man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`



#### `depth`

* Default: `Infinity` if `--all` is set, otherwise `1`
* Type: null or Number

The depth to go when recursing packages for `npm ls`


If not set, `npm ls` will show only the immediate dependencies of the root
project
 If `--all` is set, then npm will show all dependencies by default




#### `omit`

* Default: 'dev' if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to
  'production', otherwise empty

* Type: ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk


Note that these dependencies _are_ still resolved and added to the
`package-lock
json` or `npm-shrinkwrap
json` file
 They are just not
physically installed on disk


If a package type appears in both the `--include` and `--omit` lists, then
it will be included


If the resulting omit list includes `'dev'`, then the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable will be set to `'production'` for all lifecycle scripts




#### `include`

* Default:
* Type: ""prod"", ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Option that allows for defining which types of dependencies to install


This is the inverse of `--omit=<type>`


Dependency types specified in `--include` will not be omitted, regardless of
the order in which omit/include are specified on the command-line




#### `link`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Used with `npm ls`, limiting output to only those packages that are linked




#### `package-lock-only`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to true, the current operation will only use the `package-lock
json`,
ignoring `node_modules`


For `update` this means only the `package-lock
json` will be updated,
instead of checking `node_modules` and downloading dependencies


For `list` this means the output will be based on the tree described by the
`package-lock
json`, rather than the contents of `node_modules`




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `install-links`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When set file: protocol dependencies will be packed and installed as regular
dependencies instead of creating a symlink
 This option has no effect on
workspaces

title: npm-outdated
section: 1
description: Check for outdated packages
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm outdated [<package-spec> 


]
```

### Description

This command will check the registry to see if any (or, specific) installed
packages are currently outdated


By default, only the direct dependencies of the root project and direct
dependencies of your configured *workspaces* are shown

Use `--all` to find all outdated meta-dependencies as well


In the output:

* `wanted` is the maximum version of the package that satisfies the semver
  range specified in `package
json`
 If there's no available semver range
  (i
e
  you're running `npm outdated --global`, or the package isn't
  included in `package
json`), then `wanted` shows the currently-installed
  version

* `latest` is the version of the package tagged as latest in the registry

  Running `npm publish` with no special configuration will publish the
  package with a dist-tag of `latest`
 This may or may not be the maximum
  version of the package, or the most-recently published version of the
  package, depending on how the package's developer manages the latest
  [dist-tag](/commands/npm-dist-tag)

* `location` is where in the physical tree the package is located

* `depended by` shows which package depends on the displayed dependency
* `package type` (when using `--long` / `-l`) tells you whether this
  package is a `dependency` or a dev/peer/optional dependency
 Packages not
  included in `package
json` are always marked `dependencies`

* `homepage` (when using `--long` / `-l`) is the `homepage` value contained
  in the package's packument
* Red means there's a newer version matching your semver requirements, so
  you should update now

* Yellow indicates that there's a newer version _above_ your semver
  requirements (usually new major, or new 0
x minor) so proceed with
  caution


### An example

```bash
$ npm outdated
Package      Current   Wanted   Latest  Location                  Depended by
glob          5
0
15   5
0
15    6
0
1  node_modules/glob         dependent-package-name
nothingness    0
0
3      git      git  node_modules/nothingness  dependent-package-name
npm            3
5
1    3
5
2    3
5
1  node_modules/npm          dependent-package-name
local-dev      0
0
3   linked   linked  local-dev                 dependent-package-name
once           1
3
2    1
3
3    1
3
3  node_modules/once         dependent-package-name
```

With these `dependencies`:
```json
{
  ""glob"": ""^5
0
15"",
  ""nothingness"": ""github:othiym23/nothingness#master"",
  ""npm"": ""^3
5
1"",
  ""once"": ""^1
3
1""
}
```

A few things to note:

* `glob` requires `^5`, which prevents npm from installing `glob@6`, which
  is outside the semver range

* Git dependencies will always be reinstalled, because of how they're
  specified
  The installed committish might satisfy the dependency
  specifier (if it's something immutable, like a commit SHA), or it might
  not, so `npm outdated` and `npm update` have to fetch Git repos to check

  This is why currently doing a reinstall of a Git dependency always forces
  a new clone and install

* `npm@3
5
2` is marked as ""wanted"", but ""latest"" is `npm@3
5
1` because
  npm uses dist-tags to manage its `latest` and `next` release channels

  `npm update` will install the _newest_ version, but `npm install npm`
  (with no semver range) will install whatever's tagged as `latest`

* `once` is just plain out of date
 Reinstalling `node_modules` from
  scratch or running `npm update` will bring it up to spec


### Configuration

#### `all`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When running `npm outdated` and `npm ls`, setting `--all` will show all
outdated or installed packages, rather than only those directly depended
upon by the current project




#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output


* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON
parse() before
  saving them to your `package
json`


Not supported by all npm commands




#### `long`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Show extended information in `ls`, `search`, and `help-search`




#### `parseable`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Output parseable results from commands that write to standard output
 For
`npm search`, this will be tab-separated table format




#### `global`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Operates in ""global"" mode, so that packages are installed into the `prefix`
folder instead of the current working directory
 See
[folders](/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior


* packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead
  of the current working directory

* bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
* man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`



#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes

title: npm-owner
section: 1
description: Manage package owners
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm owner add <user> <package-spec>
npm owner rm <user> <package-spec>
npm owner ls <package-spec>

alias: author
```

### Description

Manage ownership of published packages


* ls: List all the users who have access to modify a package and push new
  versions
  Handy when you need to know who to bug for help

* add: Add a new user as a maintainer of a package
  This user is enabled
  to modify metadata, publish new versions, and add other owners

* rm: Remove a user from the package owner list


Note that there is only one level of access
  Either you can modify a package,
or you can't
  Future versions may contain more fine-grained access levels, but
that is not implemented at this time


If you have two-factor authentication enabled with `auth-and-writes` (see
[`npm-profile`](/commands/npm-profile)) then you'll need to go through a second factor
flow when changing ownership or include an otp on the command line with `--otp`


### Configuration

#### `registry`

* Default: ""https://registry
npmjs
org/""
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry




#### `otp`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator
 It's needed
when publishing or changing package permissions with `npm access`


If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time
password, npm will prompt on the command line for one




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes

title: npm-pack
section: 1
description: Create a tarball from a package
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm pack <package-spec>
```

### Configuration

#### `dry-run`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done
 This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, `install`, `update`,
`dedupe`, `uninstall`, as well as `pack` and `publish`


Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg `dist-tags`,
`owner`, etc




#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output


* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON
parse() before
  saving them to your `package
json`


Not supported by all npm commands




#### `pack-destination`

* Default: ""
""
* Type: String

Directory in which `npm pack` will save tarballs




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a

This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


### Description

For anything that's installable (that is, a package folder, tarball,
tarball url, git url, name@tag, name@version, name, or scoped name), this
command will fetch it to the cache, copy the tarball to the current working
directory as `<name>-<version>
tgz`, and then write the filenames out to
stdout


If the same package is specified multiple times, then the file will be
overwritten the second time


If no arguments are supplied, then npm packs the current package folder

description: Manages your package
json

### Synopsis

```bash
npm pkg set <key>=<value> [<key>=<value> 


]
npm pkg get [<key> [<key> 


]]
npm pkg delete <key> [<key> 


]
npm pkg set [<array>[<index>]
<key>=<value> 


]
npm pkg set [<array>[]
<key>=<value> 


]
npm pkg fix
```

### Description

A command that automates the management of `package
json` files

`npm pkg` provide 3 different sub commands that allow you to modify or retrieve
values for given object keys in your `package
json`


The syntax to retrieve and set fields is a dot separated representation of
the nested object properties to be found within your `package
json`, it's the
same notation used in [`npm view`](/commands/npm-view) to retrieve information
from the registry manifest, below you can find more examples on how to use it


Returned values are always in **json** format


* `npm pkg get <field>`

    Retrieves a value `key`, defined in your `package
json` file


    For example, in order to retrieve the name of the current package, you
    can run:

    ```bash
    npm pkg get name
    ```

    It's also possible to retrieve multiple values at once:

    ```bash
    npm pkg get name version
    ```

    You can view child fields by separating them with a period
 To retrieve
    the value of a test `script` value, you would run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm pkg get scripts
test
    ```

    For fields that are arrays, requesting a non-numeric field will return
    all of the values from the objects in the list
 For example, to get all
    the contributor emails for a package, you would run:

    ```bash
    npm pkg get contributors
email
    ```

    You may also use numeric indices in square braces to specifically select
    an item in an array field
 To just get the email address of the first
    contributor in the list, you can run:

    ```bash
    npm pkg get contributors[0]
email
    ```

    For complex fields you can also name a property in square brackets
    to specifically select a child field
 This is especially helpful
    with the exports object:

    ```bash
    npm pkg get ""exports[
]
require""
    ```

* `npm pkg set <field>=<value>`

    Sets a `value` in your `package
json` based on the `field` value
 When
    saving to your `package
json` file the same set of rules used during
    `npm install` and other cli commands that touches the `package
json` file
    are used, making sure to respect the existing indentation and possibly
    applying some validation prior to saving values to the file


    The same syntax used to retrieve values from your package can also be used
    to define new properties or overriding existing ones, below are some
    examples of how the dot separated syntax can be used to edit your
    `package
json` file


    Defining a new bin named `mynewcommand` in your `package
json` that points
    to a file `cli
js`:

    ```bash
    npm pkg set bin
mynewcommand=cli
js
    ```

    Setting multiple fields at once is also possible:

    ```bash
    npm pkg set description='Awesome package' engines
node='>=10'
    ```

    It's also possible to add to array values, for example to add a new
    contributor entry:

    ```bash
    npm pkg set contributors[0]
name='Foo' contributors[0]
email='foo@bar
ca'
    ```

    You may also append items to the end of an array using the special
    empty bracket notation:

    ```bash
    npm pkg set contributors[]
name='Foo' contributors[]
name='Bar'
    ```

    It's also possible to parse values as json prior to saving them to your
    `package
json` file, for example in order to set a `""private"": true`
    property:

    ```bash
    npm pkg set private=true --json
    ```

    It also enables saving values as numbers:

    ```bash
    npm pkg set tap
json`

    The same syntax used to set values from your package can also be used
    to remove existing ones
 For example, in order to remove a script named
    build:

    ```bash
    npm pkg delete scripts
build
    ```

* `npm pkg fix`

    Auto corrects common errors in your `package
json`
  npm already
    does this during `publish`, which leads to subtle (mostly harmless)
    differences between the contents of your `package
json` file and the
    manifest that npm uses during installation


### Workspaces support

You can set/get/delete items across your configured workspaces by using the
[`workspace`](/using-npm/config#workspace) or
[`workspaces`](/using-npm/config#workspaces) config options


For example, setting a `funding` value across all configured workspaces
of a project:

```bash
npm pkg set funding=https://example
com --ws
```

When using `npm pkg get` to retrieve info from your configured workspaces, the
returned result will be in a json format in which top level keys are the
names of each workspace, the values of these keys will be the result values
returned from each of the configured workspaces, e
g:

```
npm pkg get name version --ws
{
  ""a"": {
    ""name"": ""a"",
    ""version"": ""1
0
0""
  },
  ""b"": {
    ""name"": ""b"",
    ""version"": ""1
0
0""
  }
}
```

### Configuration

#### `force`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Removes various protections against unfortunate side effects, common
mistakes, unnecessary performance degradation, and malicious input


* Allow clobbering non-npm files in global installs

* Allow the `npm version` command to work on an unclean git repository

* Allow deleting the cache folder with `npm cache clean`

* Allow installing packages that have an `engines` declaration requiring a
  different version of npm

* Allow installing packages that have an `engines` declaration requiring a
  different version of `node`, even if `--engine-strict` is enabled

* Allow `npm audit fix` to install modules outside your stated dependency
  range (including SemVer-major changes)

* Allow unpublishing all versions of a published package

* Allow conflicting peerDependencies to be installed in the root project

* Implicitly set `--yes` during `npm init`

* Allow clobbering existing values in `npm pkg`
* Allow unpublishing of entire packages (not just a single version)


If you don't have a clear idea of what you want to do, it is strongly
recommended that you do not use this option!



#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output


* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON
parse() before
  saving them to your `package
json`


Not supported by all npm commands




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes

section: 1
description: Display prefix
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm prefix [-g]
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

Print the local prefix to standard output
 This is the closest parent directory
to contain a `package
json` file or `node_modules` directory, unless `-g` is
also specified


If `-g` is specified, this will be the value of the global prefix
 See
[`npm config`](/commands/npm-config) for more detail


### Example

```bash
npm prefix
/usr/local/projects/foo
```

```bash
npm prefix -g
/usr/local
```

### Configuration

#### `global`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Operates in ""global"" mode, so that packages are installed into the `prefix`
folder instead of the current working directory
 See
[folders](/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior


* packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead
  of the current working directory

* bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
* man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`

npm profile get [<key>]
npm profile set <key> <value>
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

Change your profile information on the registry
  Note that this command
depends on the registry implementation, so third-party registries may not
support this interface


* `npm profile get [<property>]`: Display all of the properties of your
  profile, or one or more specific properties
  It looks like:

```bash
+-----------------+---------------------------+

```

* `npm profile set <property> <value>`: Set the value of a profile
  property
 You can set the following properties this way: email, fullname,
  homepage, freenode, twitter, github

* `npm profile set password`: Change your password
  This is interactive,
  you'll be prompted for your current password and a new password
  You'll
  also be prompted for an OTP if you have two-factor authentication
  enabled


* `npm profile enable-2fa [auth-and-writes|auth-only]`: Enables two-factor
  authentication
 Defaults to `auth-and-writes` mode
 Modes are:
  * `auth-only`: Require an OTP when logging in or making changes to your
    account's authentication
  The OTP will be required on both the website
    and the command line

  * `auth-and-writes`: Requires an OTP at all the times `auth-only` does,
    and also requires one when publishing a module, setting the `latest`
    dist-tag, or changing access via `npm access` and `npm owner`


* `npm profile disable-2fa`: Disables two-factor authentication


### Details

Some of these commands may not be available on non npmjs
com registries

title: npm-prune
section: 1
description: Remove extraneous packages
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm prune [[<@scope>/]<pkg>


]
```

### Description

This command removes ""extraneous"" packages
  If a package name is provided,
then only packages matching one of the supplied names are removed


Extraneous packages are those present in the `node_modules` folder that are
not listed as any package's dependency list


If the `--omit=dev` flag is specified or the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable is set to `production`, this command will remove the packages
specified in your `devDependencies`


If the `--dry-run` flag is used then no changes will actually be made


If the `--json` flag is used, then the changes `npm prune` made (or would
have made with `--dry-run`) are printed as a JSON object


In normal operation, extraneous modules are pruned automatically, so you'll
only need this command with the `--production` flag
  When crashes or mistakes happen,
this command can help clean up any resulting garbage


### Configuration

#### `omit`

* Default: 'dev' if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to
  'production', otherwise empty

* Type: ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk


Note that these dependencies _are_ still resolved and added to the
`package-lock
json` or `npm-shrinkwrap
json` file
 They are just not
physically installed on disk


If a package type appears in both the `--include` and `--omit` lists, then
it will be included


If the resulting omit list includes `'dev'`, then the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable will be set to `'production'` for all lifecycle scripts




#### `include`

* Default:
* Type: ""prod"", ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Option that allows for defining which types of dependencies to install


This is the inverse of `--omit=<type>`


Dependency types specified in `--include` will not be omitted, regardless of
the order in which omit/include are specified on the command-line




#### `dry-run`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done
 This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, `install`, `update`,
`dedupe`, `uninstall`, as well as `pack` and `publish`


Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg `dist-tags`,
`owner`, etc




#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output


* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON
parse() before
  saving them to your `package
json`


Not supported by all npm commands




#### `foreground-scripts`

* Default: `false` unless when using `npm pack` or `npm publish` where it
  defaults to `true`
* Type: Boolean

Run all build scripts (ie, `preinstall`, `install`, and `postinstall`)
scripts for installed packages in the foreground process, sharing standard
input, output, and error with the main npm process


Note that this will generally make installs run slower, and be much noisier,
but can be useful for debugging




#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package
json files


Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they
will *not* run any pre- or post-scripts




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `install-links`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When set file: protocol dependencies will be packed and installed as regular
dependencies instead of creating a symlink
 This option has no effect on
workspaces

title: npm-publish
section: 1
description: Publish a package
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm publish <package-spec>
```

### Description

Publishes a package to the registry so that it can be installed by name


By default npm will publish to the public registry
 This can be
overridden by specifying a different default registry or using a
[`scope`](/using-npm/scope) in the name, combined with a
scope-configured registry (see
[`package
json`](/configuring-npm/package-json))



A `package` is interpreted the same way as other commands (like
`npm install`) and can be:

* a) a folder containing a program described by a
  [`package
json`](/configuring-npm/package-json) file
* b) a gzipped tarball containing (a)
* c) a url that resolves to (b)
* d) a `<name>@<version>` that is published on the registry (see
  [`registry`](/using-npm/registry)) with (c)
* e) a `<name>@<tag>` (see [`npm dist-tag`](/commands/npm-dist-tag)) that
  points to (d)
* f) a `<name>` that has a ""latest"" tag satisfying (e)
* g) a `<git remote url>` that resolves to (a)

The publish will fail if the package name and version combination already
exists in the specified registry


Once a package is published with a given name and version, that specific
name and version combination can never be used again, even if it is removed
with [`npm unpublish`](/commands/npm-unpublish)


As of `npm@5`, both a sha1sum and an integrity field with a sha512sum of the
tarball will be submitted to the registry during publication
 Subsequent
installs will use the strongest supported algorithm to verify downloads


Similar to `--dry-run` see [`npm pack`](/commands/npm-pack), which figures
out the files to be included and packs them into a tarball to be uploaded
to the registry


### Files included in package

To see what will be included in your package, run `npm pack --dry-run`
  All
files are included by default, with the following exceptions:

- Certain files that are relevant to package installation and distribution
  are always included
  For example, `package
json`, `README
md`,
  `LICENSE`, and so on


- If there is a ""files"" list in
  [`package
json`](/configuring-npm/package-json), then only the files
  specified will be included
  (If directories are specified, then they
  will be walked recursively and their contents included, subject to the
  same ignore rules
)

- If there is a `
gitignore` or `
npmignore` file, then ignored files in
  that and all child directories will be excluded from the package
  If
  _both_ files exist, then the `
gitignore` is ignored, and only the
  `
npmignore` is used


  `
npmignore` files follow the [same pattern
  rules](https://git-scm
com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring)
  as `
gitignore` files

- If the file matches certain patterns, then it will _never_ be included,
  unless explicitly added to the `""files""` list in `package
json`, or
  un-ignored with a `!` rule in a `
npmignore` or `
gitignore` file


- Symbolic links are never included in npm packages



See [`developers`](/using-npm/developers) for full details on what's
included in the published package, as well as details on how the package is
built


### Configuration

#### `tag`

* Default: ""latest""
* Type: String

If you ask npm to install a package and don't tell it a specific version,
then it will install the specified tag


Also the tag that is added to the package@version specified by the `npm tag`
command, if no explicit tag is given


When used by the `npm diff` command, this is the tag used to fetch the
tarball that will be compared with the local files by default




#### `access`

* Default: 'public' for new packages, existing packages it will not change the
  current level
* Type: null, ""restricted"", or ""public""

If you do not want your scoped package to be publicly viewable (and
installable) set `--access=restricted`


Unscoped packages can not be set to `restricted`


Note: This defaults to not changing the current access level for existing
packages
 Specifying a value of `restricted` or `public` during publish will
change the access for an existing package the same way that `npm access set
status` would




#### `dry-run`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done
 This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, `install`, `update`,
`dedupe`, `uninstall`, as well as `pack` and `publish`


Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg `dist-tags`,
`owner`, etc




#### `otp`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator
 It's needed
when publishing or changing package permissions with `npm access`


If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time
password, npm will prompt on the command line for one




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `provenance`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When publishing from a supported cloud CI/CD system, the package will be
publicly linked to where it was built and published from


This config can not be used with: `provenance-file`

#### `provenance-file`

* Default: null
* Type: Path

When publishing, the provenance bundle at the given path will be used


This config can not be used with: `provenance`

### Description

The `npm query` command allows for usage of css selectors in order to retrieve
an array of dependency objects


### Piping npm query to other commands

```bash
# find all dependencies with postinstall scripts & uninstall them
npm query "":attr(scripts, [postinstall])"" | jq 'map(
name)|join(""\n"")' -r | xargs -I {} npm uninstall {}

# find all git dependencies & explain who requires them
npm query "":type(git)"" | jq 'map(
name)' | xargs -I {} npm why {}
```

  },
  



```

### Expecting a certain number of results

One common use of `npm query` is to make sure there is only one version of
a certain dependency in your tree
  This is especially common for
ecosystems like that rely on `typescript` where having state split
across two different but identically-named packages causes bugs
  You
can use the `--expect-results` or `--expect-result-count` in your setup
to ensure that npm will exit with an exit code if your tree doesn't look
like you want it to



```sh
$ npm query '#react' --expect-result-count=1
```

Perhaps you want to quickly check if there are any production
dependencies that could be updated:

```sh
$ npm query ':root>:outdated(in-range)
prod' --no-expect-results
```

### Package lock only mode

If package-lock-only is enabled, only the information in the package lock (or shrinkwrap) is loaded
  This means that information from the package
json files of your dependencies will not be included in the result set (e
g
 description, homepage, engines)


### Configuration

#### `global`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Operates in ""global"" mode, so that packages are installed into the `prefix`
folder instead of the current working directory
 See
[folders](/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior


* packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead
  of the current working directory

* bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
* man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`



#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `package-lock-only`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to true, the current operation will only use the `package-lock
json`,
ignoring `node_modules`


For `update` this means only the `package-lock
json` will be updated,
instead of checking `node_modules` and downloading dependencies


For `list` this means the output will be based on the tree described by the
`package-lock
json`, rather than the contents of `node_modules`




#### `expect-results`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Tells npm whether or not to expect results from the command
 Can be either
true (expect some results) or false (expect no results)


This config can not be used with: `expect-result-count`

#### `expect-result-count`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Number

Tells to expect a specific number of results from the command


This config can not be used with: `expect-results`

title: npm-rebuild
section: 1
description: Rebuild a package
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm rebuild [<package-spec>] 


]

alias: rb
```

### Description

This command does the following:

1
 Execute lifecycle scripts (`preinstall`, `install`, `postinstall`, `prepare`)
2
 Links bins depending on whether bin links are enabled

This command is particularly useful in scenarios including but not limited to:

1
 Installing a new version of **node
js**, where you need to recompile all your C++ add-ons with the updated binary

2
 Installing with `--ignore-scripts` and `--no-bin-links`, to explicitly choose which packages to build and/or link bins


If one or more package specs are provided, then only packages with a name and version matching one of the specifiers will be rebuilt


Usually, you should not need to run `npm rebuild` as it is already done for you as part of npm install (unless you suppressed these steps with `--ignore-scripts` or `--no-bin-links`)


If there is a `binding
gyp` file in the root of your package, then npm will use a default install hook:

```
""scripts"": {
    ""install"": ""node-gyp rebuild""
}
```

This default behavior is suppressed if the `package
json` has its own `install` or `preinstall` scripts
 It is also suppressed if the package specifies `""gypfile"": false`

### Configuration

#### `global`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Operates in ""global"" mode, so that packages are installed into the `prefix`
folder instead of the current working directory
 See
[folders](/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior

  of the current working directory

* bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
* man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`



#### `bin-links`

cmd` shims on Windows) for package
executables


Set to false to have it not do this




#### `foreground-scripts`

* Default: `false` unless when using `npm pack` or `npm publish` where it
  defaults to `true`
* Type: Boolean

Run all build scripts (ie, `preinstall`, `install`, and `postinstall`)
scripts for installed packages in the foreground process, sharing standard
input, output, and error with the main npm process


Note that this will generally make installs run slower, and be much noisier,
but can be useful for debugging




#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package
json files


Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they
will *not* run any pre- or post-scripts




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a

brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to

) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `install-links`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When set file: protocol dependencies will be packed and installed as regular
dependencies instead of creating a symlink

json files


Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they
will *not* run any pre- or post-scripts




#### `script-shell`

* Default: '/bin/sh' on POSIX systems, 'cmd
exe' on Windows
* Type: null or String

The shell to use for scripts run with the `npm exec`, `npm run` and `npm
init <package-spec>` commands

title: npm-root
section: 1
description: Display npm root
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm root
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

Print the effective `node_modules` folder to standard out


Useful for using npm in shell scripts that do things with the
`node_modules` folder
  For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
global_node_modules=""$(npm root --global)""
echo ""Global packages installed in: ${global_node_modules}""
```

### Configuration

#### `global`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Operates in ""global"" mode, so that packages are installed into the `prefix`
folder instead of the current working directory
 See
[folders](/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior


* packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead
  of the current working directory

* bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
* man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`

title: npm-run-script
section: 1
description: Run arbitrary package scripts
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm run-script <command> [-- <args>]

aliases: run, rum, urn
```

### Description

This runs an arbitrary command from a package's `""scripts""` object
  If no
`""command""` is provided, it will list the available scripts


`run[-script]` is used by the test, start, restart, and stop commands, but
can be called directly, as well
 When the scripts in the package are
printed out, they're separated into lifecycle (test, start, restart) and
directly-run scripts


Any positional arguments are passed to the specified script
  Use `--` to
pass `-`-prefixed flags and options which would otherwise be parsed by npm


For example:

```bash
npm run test -- --grep=""pattern""
```

The arguments will only be passed to the script specified after `npm run`
and not to any `pre` or `post` script


The `env` script is a special built-in command that can be used to list
environment variables that will be available to the script at runtime
 If an
""env"" command is defined in your package, it will take precedence over the
built-in


In addition to the shell's pre-existing `PATH`, `npm run` adds
`node_modules/
bin` to the `PATH` provided to scripts
 Any binaries
provided by locally-installed dependencies can be used without the
`node_modules/
bin` prefix
 For example, if there is a `devDependency` on
`tap` in your package, you should write:

```bash
""scripts"": {""test"": ""tap test/*
js""}
```

instead of

```bash
""scripts"": {""test"": ""node_modules/
bin/tap test/*
js""}
```

The actual shell your script is run within is platform dependent
 By default,
on Unix-like systems it is the `/bin/sh` command, on Windows it is
`cmd
exe`

The actual shell referred to by `/bin/sh` also depends on the system

You can customize the shell with the
[`script-shell` config](/using-npm/config#script-shell)


Scripts are run from the root of the package folder, regardless of what the
current working directory is when `npm run` is called
 If you want your
script to use different behavior based on what subdirectory you're in, you
can use the `INIT_CWD` environment variable, which holds the full path you
were in when you ran `npm run`


`npm run` sets the `NODE` environment variable to the `node` executable
with which `npm` is executed


If you try to run a script without having a `node_modules` directory and it
fails, you will be given a warning to run `npm install`, just in case you've
forgotten


### Workspaces support

You may use the [`workspace`](/using-npm/config#workspace) or
[`workspaces`](/using-npm/config#workspaces) configs in order to run an
arbitrary command from a package's `""scripts""` object in the context of the
specified workspaces
 If no `""command""` is provided, it will list the available
scripts for each of these configured workspaces


Given a project with configured workspaces, e
g:

```


+-- package
json
`-- packages
   +-- a
   |   `-- package
json
   +-- b
   |   `-- package
json
   `-- c
       `-- package
json
```

Assuming the workspace configuration is properly set up at the root level
`package
json` file
 e
g:

```
{
    ""workspaces"": [ ""
/packages/*"" ]
}
```

And that each of the configured workspaces has a configured `test` script,
we can run tests in all of them using the
[`workspaces` config](/using-npm/config#workspaces):

```
npm test --workspaces
```

#### Filtering workspaces

It's also possible to run a script in a single workspace using the `workspace`
config along with a name or directory path:

```
npm test --workspace=a
```

The `workspace` config can also be specified multiple times in order to run a
specific script in the context of multiple workspaces
 When defining values for
the `workspace` config in the command line, it also possible to use `-w` as a
shorthand, e
g:

```
npm test -w a -w b
```

This last command will run `test` in both `
/packages/a` and `
/packages/b`
packages


### Configuration

#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `if-present`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm will not exit with an error code when `run-script` is invoked
for a script that isn't defined in the `scripts` section of `package
json`

This option can be used when it's desirable to optionally run a script when
it's present and fail if the script fails
 This is useful, for example, when
running scripts that may only apply for some builds in an otherwise generic
CI setup


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package
json files


Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they
will *not* run any pre- or post-scripts




#### `foreground-scripts`

* Default: `false` unless when using `npm pack` or `npm publish` where it
  defaults to `true`
* Type: Boolean

Run all build scripts (ie, `preinstall`, `install`, and `postinstall`)
scripts for installed packages in the foreground process, sharing standard
input, output, and error with the main npm process


Note that this will generally make installs run slower, and be much noisier,
but can be useful for debugging




#### `script-shell`

* Default: '/bin/sh' on POSIX systems, 'cmd
exe' on Windows
* Type: null or String

The shell to use for scripts run with the `npm exec`, `npm run` and `npm
init <package-spec>` commands

### Package lock only mode

If package-lock-only is enabled, only the information in the package
lock (or shrinkwrap) is loaded
  This means that information from the
package
json files of your dependencies will not be included in the
result set (e
g
 description, homepage, engines)


### Configuration

#### `omit`

* Default: 'dev' if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to
  'production', otherwise empty

* Type: ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk


Note that these dependencies _are_ still resolved and added to the
`package-lock
json` or `npm-shrinkwrap
json` file
 They are just not
physically installed on disk


If a package type appears in both the `--include` and `--omit` lists, then
it will be included


If the resulting omit list includes `'dev'`, then the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable will be set to `'production'` for all lifecycle scripts




#### `package-lock-only`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to true, the current operation will only use the `package-lock
json`,
ignoring `node_modules`


For `update` this means only the `package-lock
json` will be updated,
instead of checking `node_modules` and downloading dependencies


For `list` this means the output will be based on the tree described by the
`package-lock
json`, rather than the contents of `node_modules`




#### `sbom-format`

* Default: null
* Type: ""cyclonedx"" or ""spdx""

SBOM format to use when generating SBOMs




#### `sbom-type`

* Default: ""library""
* Type: ""library"", ""application"", or ""framework""

The type of package described by the generated SBOM
 For SPDX, this is the
value for the `primaryPackagePurpose` field
 For CycloneDX, this is the
value for the `type` field




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes

title: npm-search
section: 1
description: Search for packages
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm search [search terms 


]

aliases: find, s, se
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

Search the registry for packages matching the search terms
 `npm search`
performs a linear, incremental, lexically-ordered search through package
metadata for all files in the registry
 If your terminal has color
support, it will further highlight the matches in the results
  This can
be disabled with the config item `color`

Additionally, using the `--searchopts` and `--searchexclude` options
paired with more search terms will include and exclude further patterns

The main difference between `--searchopts` and the standard search terms
is that the former does not highlight results in the output and you can
use them more fine-grained filtering
 Additionally, you can add both of
these to your config to change default search filtering behavior


Search also allows targeting of maintainers in search results, by prefixing
their npm username with `=`


If a term starts with `/`, then it's interpreted as a regular expression
and supports standard JavaScript RegExp syntax
 In this case search will
ignore a trailing `/` 
  (Note you must escape or quote many regular
expression characters in most shells
)

### Configuration

#### `long`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Show extended information in `ls`, `search`, and `help-search`




#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output


* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON
parse() before
  saving them to your `package
json`


Not supported by all npm commands




#### `color`

* Default: true unless the NO_COLOR environ is set to something other than '0'
* Type: ""always"" or Boolean

If false, never shows colors
 If
true, then only prints color codes for tty file descriptors




#### `parseable`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Output parseable results from commands that write to standard output
 For
`npm search`, this will be tab-separated table format




#### `description`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Show the description in `npm search`



#### `searchlimit`

* Default: 20
* Type: Number

Number of items to limit search results to
 Will not apply at all to legacy
searches




#### `searchopts`

* Default: """"
* Type: String

Space-separated options that are always passed to search




#### `searchexclude`

* Default: """"
* Type: String

Space-separated options that limit the results from search




#### `registry`

* Default: ""https://registry
npmjs
org/""
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry




#### `prefer-online`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, staleness checks for cached data will be forced, making the CLI
look for updates immediately even for fresh package data




#### `prefer-offline`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, staleness checks for cached data will be bypassed, but missing data
will be requested from the server
 To force full offline mode, use
`--offline`




#### `offline`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Force offline mode: no network requests will be done during install
 To
allow the CLI to fill in missing cache data, see `--prefer-offline`

title: npm-shrinkwrap
section: 1
description: Lock down dependency versions for publication
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm shrinkwrap
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

This command repurposes `package-lock
json` into a publishable
`npm-shrinkwrap
json` or simply creates a new one
 The file created and
updated by this command will then take precedence over any other existing
or future `package-lock
json` files

design and purpose of package locks in npm, see
[package-lock-json](/configuring-npm/package-lock-json)

title: npm-star
section: 1
description: Mark your favorite packages
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm star [<package-spec>


]
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

""Starring"" a package means that you have some interest in it


It's a boolean thing
 Starring repeatedly has no additional effect


### More

There's also these extra commands to help you manage your favorite packages:

#### Unstar

You can also ""unstar"" a package using [`npm unstar`](/commands/npm-unstar)

""Unstarring"" is the same thing, but in reverse


#### Listing stars

You can see all your starred packages using [`npm stars`](/commands/npm-stars)

### Configuration

#### `registry`

* Default: ""https://registry
npmjs

```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

If you have starred a lot of neat things and want to find them again
quickly this command lets you do just that


You may also want to see your friend's favorite packages, in this case
you will most certainly enjoy this command


### Configuration

#### `registry`

* Default: ""https://registry
npmjs
org/""

title: npm-start
section: 1
description: Start a package
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm start [-- <args>]
```

### Description

This runs a predefined command specified in the `""start""` property of
a package's `""scripts""` object


If the `""scripts""` object does not define a  `""start""` property, npm
will run `node server
js`


Note that this is different from the default node behavior of running
the file specified in a package's `""main""` attribute when evoking with
`node 
`

As of [`npm@2
0
0`](https://blog
npmjs
org/post/98131109725/npm-2-0-0), you can
use custom arguments when executing scripts
 Refer to [`npm run-script`](/commands/npm-run-script) for more details


### Example

```json
{
  ""scripts"": {
    ""start"": ""node foo
js""
  }
}
```

```bash
npm start

> npm@x
x start
> node foo
js

(foo
js output would be here)

```

### Configuration

#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package
json files


Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they
will *not* run any pre- or post-scripts




#### `script-shell`

* Default: '/bin/sh' on POSIX systems, 'cmd
exe' on Windows
* Type: null or String

The shell to use for scripts run with the `npm exec`, `npm run` and `npm
init <package-spec>` commands




### See Also

* [npm run-script](/commands/npm-run-script)

title: npm-stop
section: 1
description: Stop a package
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm stop [-- <args>]
```

### Description

This runs a predefined command specified in the ""stop"" property of a
package's ""scripts"" object


Unlike with [npm start](/commands/npm-start), there is no default script
that will run if the `""stop""` property is not defined


### Example

```json
{
  ""scripts"": {
    ""stop"": ""node bar
js""
  }
}
```

```bash
npm stop

> npm@x
x stop
> node bar
js

(bar
js output would be here)

```

### Configuration

#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package
json files


Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they

title: npm-team
section: 1
description: Manage organization teams and team memberships
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm team create <scope:team> [--otp <otpcode>]
npm team destroy <scope:team> [--otp <otpcode>]
npm team add <scope:team> <user> [--otp <otpcode>]
npm team rm <scope:team> <user> [--otp <otpcode>]
npm team ls <scope>|<scope:team>
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

Used to manage teams in organizations, and change team memberships
 Does not
handle permissions for packages


Teams must always be fully qualified with the organization/scope they belong to
when operating on them, separated by a colon (`:`)
 That is, if you have a
`newteam` team in an `org` organization, you must always refer to that team
as `@org:newteam` in these commands


If you have two-factor authentication enabled in `auth-and-writes` mode, then
you can provide a code from your authenticator with `[--otp <otpcode>]`

If you don't include this then you will be taken through a second factor flow based
on your `authtype`


* create / destroy:
  Create a new team, or destroy an existing one
 Note: You cannot remove the
  `developers` team, [learn more
](https://docs
npmjs
com/about-developers-team)

  Here's how to create a new team `newteam` under the `org` org:

  ```bash
  npm team create @org:newteam
  ```

  You should see a confirming message such as: `+@org:newteam` once the new
  team has been created


* add:
  Add a user to an existing team


  Adding a new user `username` to a team named `newteam` under the `org` org:

  ```bash
  npm team add @org:newteam username
  ```

  On success, you should see a message: `username added to @org:newteam`

* rm:
  Using `npm team rm` you can also remove users from a team they belong to


  Here's an example removing user `username` from `newteam` team
  in `org` organization:

  ```bash
  npm team rm @org:newteam username
  ```

  Once the user is removed a confirmation message is displayed:
  `username removed from @org:newteam`

* ls:
  If performed on an organization name, will return a list of existing teams
  under that organization


  Here's an example of how to list all teams from an org named `org`:

  ```bash
  npm team ls @org
  ```

  Example listing all members of a team named `newteam`:

  ```bash
  npm team ls @org:newteam
  ```

### Details

`npm team` always operates directly on the current registry, configurable from
the command line using `--registry=<registry url>`


You must be a *team admin* to create teams and manage team membership, under
the given organization
 Listing teams and team memberships may be done by
any member of the organization


Organization creation and management of team admins and *organization* members
is done through the website, not the npm CLI


To use teams to manage permissions on packages belonging to your organization,
use the `npm access` command to grant or revoke the appropriate permissions


### Configuration

#### `registry`

* Default: ""https://registry
npmjs
org/""
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry




#### `otp`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator
 It's needed
when publishing or changing package permissions with `npm access`


If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time
password, npm will prompt on the command line for one




#### `parseable`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Output parseable results from commands that write to standard output
 For
`npm search`, this will be tab-separated table format




#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output


* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON
parse() before
  saving them to your `package
json`


Not supported by all npm commands

(test
js output would be here)
```

### Configuration

#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package
json files


Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they
will *not* run any pre- or post-scripts




#### `script-shell`

* Default: '/bin/sh' on POSIX systems, 'cmd
exe' on Windows
* Type: null or String

The shell to use for scripts run with the `npm exec`, `npm run` and `npm
init <package-spec>` commands

description: Manage your authentication tokens
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm token list
npm token revoke <id|token>
npm token create [--read-only] [--cidr=list]
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

This lets you list, create and revoke authentication tokens


* `npm token list`:
  Shows a table of all active authentication tokens
 You can request
  this as JSON with `--json` or tab-separated values with `--parseable`


```bash
+--------+---------+------------+----------+----------------+
| id     | token   | created    | read-only | CIDR whitelist |
+--------+---------+------------+----------+----------------+

```

* `npm token create [--read-only] [--cidr=<cidr-ranges>]`:
  Create a new authentication token
 It can be `--read-only`, or accept
  a list of
  [CIDR](https://en
wikipedia
org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing)
  ranges with which to limit use of this token
 This will prompt you for
  your password, and, if you have two-factor authentication enabled, an
  otp


  Currently, the cli can not generate automation tokens
 Please refer to
  the [docs
  website](https://docs
npmjs
com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens)
  for more information on generating automation tokens

```

* `npm token revoke <token|id>`:
  Immediately removes an authentication token from the registry
  You
  will no longer be able to use it
  This can accept both complete
  tokens (such as those you get back from `npm token create`, and those
  found in your `
npmrc`), and ids as seen in the parseable or json
  output of `npm token list`
  This will NOT accept the truncated token
  found in the normal `npm token list` output

title: npm-uninstall
section: 1
description: Remove a package
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm uninstall [<@scope>/]<pkg>




aliases: unlink, remove, rm, r, un
```

### Description

This uninstalls a package, completely removing everything npm installed
on its behalf


It also removes the package from the `dependencies`, `devDependencies`,
`optionalDependencies`, and `peerDependencies` objects in your
`package
json`


Further, if you have an `npm-shrinkwrap
json` or `package-lock
json`, npm
will update those files as well


`--no-save` will tell npm not to remove the package from your
`package
json`, `npm-shrinkwrap
json`, or `package-lock
json` files


`--save` or `-S` will tell npm to remove the package from your
`package
json`, `npm-shrinkwrap
json`, and `package-lock
json` files

This is the default, but you may need to use this if you have for
instance `save=false` in your `npmrc` file

In global mode (ie, with `-g` or `--global` appended to the command),
it uninstalls the current package context as a global package

`--no-save` is ignored in this case


Scope is optional and follows the usual rules for [`scope`](/using-npm/scope)


### Examples

```bash
npm uninstall sax
```

`sax` will no longer be in your `package
json`, `npm-shrinkwrap
json`, or
`package-lock
json` files


```bash
npm uninstall lodash --no-save
```

`lodash` will not be removed from your `package
json`,
`npm-shrinkwrap
json`, or `package-lock
json` files


### Configuration

#### `save`

* Default: `true` unless when using `npm update` where it defaults to `false`
* Type: Boolean

Save installed packages to a `package
json` file as dependencies


When used with the `npm rm` command, removes the dependency from
`package
json`


Will also prevent writing to `package-lock
json` if set to `false`




#### `global`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Operates in ""global"" mode, so that packages are installed into the `prefix`
folder instead of the current working directory
 See
[folders](/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior


* packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead
  of the current working directory

* bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
* man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`



#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `install-links`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When set file: protocol dependencies will be packed and installed as regular
dependencies instead of creating a symlink
 This option has no effect on
workspaces

title: npm-unpublish
section: 1
description: Remove a package from the registry
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm unpublish [<package-spec>]
```

To learn more about how the npm registry treats unpublish, see our
[unpublish policies](https://docs
npmjs
com/policies/unpublish)


### Warning

Consider using the [`deprecate`](/commands/npm-deprecate) command instead,
if your intent is to encourage users to upgrade, or if you no longer
want to maintain a package


### Description

This removes a package version from the registry, deleting its entry and
removing the tarball


The npm registry will return an error if you are not [logged
in](/commands/npm-adduser)


If you do not specify a package name at all, the name and version to be
unpublished will be pulled from the project in the current directory


If you specify a package name but do not specify a version or if you
remove all of a package's versions then the registry will remove the
root package entry entirely


Even if you unpublish a package version, that specific name and version
combination can never be reused
 In order to publish the package again,
you must use a new version number
 If you unpublish the entire package,
you may not publish any new versions of that package until 24 hours have
passed


### Configuration

#### `dry-run`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done
 This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, `install`, `update`,
`dedupe`, `uninstall`, as well as `pack` and `publish`


Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg `dist-tags`,
`owner`, etc




#### `force`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Removes various protections against unfortunate side effects, common
mistakes, unnecessary performance degradation, and malicious input


* Allow clobbering non-npm files in global installs

* Allow the `npm version` command to work on an unclean git repository

* Allow deleting the cache folder with `npm cache clean`

* Allow installing packages that have an `engines` declaration requiring a
  different version of npm

* Allow installing packages that have an `engines` declaration requiring a
  different version of `node`, even if `--engine-strict` is enabled

* Allow `npm audit fix` to install modules outside your stated dependency
  range (including SemVer-major changes)

* Allow unpublishing all versions of a published package

* Allow conflicting peerDependencies to be installed in the root project

* Implicitly set `--yes` during `npm init`

* Allow clobbering existing values in `npm pkg`
* Allow unpublishing of entire packages (not just a single version)


If you don't have a clear idea of what you want to do, it is strongly
recommended that you do not use this option!



#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes

title: npm-unstar
section: 1
description: Remove an item from your favorite packages
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm unstar [<package-spec>


]
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

""Unstarring"" a package is the opposite of [`npm star`](/commands/npm-star),
it removes an item from your list of favorite packages


### More

There's also these extra commands to help you manage your favorite packages:

#### Star

You can ""star"" a package using [`npm star`](/commands/npm-star)

#### Listing stars

You can see all your starred packages using [`npm stars`](/commands/npm-stars)

### Configuration

#### `registry`

* Default: ""https://registry
npmjs
org/""
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry




#### `otp`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator
 It's needed
when publishing or changing package permissions with `npm access`


If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time
password, npm will prompt on the command line for one

title: npm-update
section: 1
description: Update packages
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm update [<pkg>


]

aliases: up, upgrade, udpate
```

### Description

This command will update all the packages listed to the latest version
(specified by the [`tag` config](/using-npm/config#tag)), respecting the semver
constraints of both your package and its dependencies (if they also require the
same package)


It will also install missing packages


If the `-g` flag is specified, this command will update globally installed
packages


If no package name is specified, all packages in the specified location (global
or local) will be updated


Note that by default `npm update` will not update the semver values of direct
dependencies in your project `package
json`
 If you want to also update
values in `package
json` you can run: `npm update --save` (or add the
`save=true` option to a [configuration file](/configuring-npm/npmrc)
to make that the default behavior)


### Example

For the examples below, assume that the current package is `app` and it depends
on dependencies, `dep1` (`dep2`, 

 etc
)
  The published versions of `dep1`
are:

```json
{
  ""dist-tags"": { ""latest"": ""1
2
2"" },
  ""versions"": [
    ""1
2
2"",
    ""1
2
1"",
    ""1
2
0"",
    ""1
1
2"",
    ""1
1
1"",
    ""1
0
0"",
    ""0
4
1"",
    ""0
4
0"",
    ""0
2
0""
  ]
}
```

#### Caret Dependencies

If `app`'s `package
json` contains:

```json
""dependencies"": {
  ""dep1"": ""^1
1
1""
}
```

Then `npm update` will install `dep1@1
2
2`, because `1
2
2` is `latest` and
`1
2
2` satisfies `^1
1
1`


#### Tilde Dependencies

However, if `app`'s `package
json` contains:

```json
""dependencies"": {
  ""dep1"": ""~1
1
1""
}
```

In this case, running `npm update` will install `dep1@1
1
2`
  Even though the
`latest` tag points to `1
2
2`, this version does not satisfy `~1
1
1`, which is
equivalent to `>=1
1
1 <1
2
0`
  So the highest-sorting version that satisfies
`~1
1
1` is used, which is `1
1
2`


#### Caret Dependencies below 1
0
0

Suppose `app` has a caret dependency on a version below `1
0
0`, for example:

```json
""dependencies"": {
  ""dep1"": ""^0
2
0""
}
```

`npm update` will install `dep1@0
2
0`


If the dependence were on `^0
4
0`:

```json
""dependencies"": {
  ""dep1"": ""^0
4
0""
}
```

Then `npm update` will install `dep1@0
4
1`, because that is the highest-sorting
version that satisfies `^0
4
0` (`>= 0
4
0 <0
5
0`)


#### Subdependencies

Suppose your app now also has a dependency on `dep2`

```json
{
  ""name"": ""my-app"",
  ""dependencies"": {
      ""dep1"": ""^1
0
0"",
      ""dep2"": ""1
0
0""
  }
}
```

and `dep2` itself depends on this limited range of `dep1`

```json
{
""name"": ""dep2"",
  ""dependencies"": {
    ""dep1"": ""~1
1
1""
  }
}
```

Then `npm update` will install `dep1@1
1
2` because that is the highest
version that `dep2` allows
  npm will prioritize having a single version
of `dep1` in your tree rather than two when that single version can
satisfy the semver requirements of multiple dependencies in your tree

In this case if you really did need your package to use a newer version
you would need to use `npm install`



#### Updating Globally-Installed Packages

`npm update -g` will apply the `update` action to each globally installed
package that is `outdated` -- that is, has a version that is different from
`wanted`


Note: Globally installed packages are treated as if they are installed with a
caret semver range specified
 So if you require to update to `latest` you may
need to run `npm install -g [<pkg>


]`

NOTE: If a package has been upgraded to a version newer than `latest`, it will
be _downgraded_


### Configuration

#### `save`

* Default: `true` unless when using `npm update` where it defaults to `false`
* Type: Boolean

Save installed packages to a `package
json` file as dependencies


When used with the `npm rm` command, removes the dependency from
`package
json`


Will also prevent writing to `package-lock
json` if set to `false`




#### `global`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Operates in ""global"" mode, so that packages are installed into the `prefix`
folder instead of the current working directory
 See
[folders](/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior


* packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead
  of the current working directory

* bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
* man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`



#### `install-strategy`

* Default: ""hoisted""
* Type: ""hoisted"", ""nested"", ""shallow"", or ""linked""

Sets the strategy for installing packages in node_modules
 hoisted
(default): Install non-duplicated in top-level, and duplicated as necessary
within directory structure
 nested: (formerly --legacy-bundling) install in
place, no hoisting
 shallow (formerly --global-style) only install direct
deps at top-level
 linked: (experimental) install in node_modules/
store,
link in place, unhoisted




#### `legacy-bundling`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=nested`

Instead of hoisting package installs in `node_modules`, install packages in
the same manner that they are depended on
 This may cause very deep
directory structures and duplicate package installs as there is no
de-duplicating
 Sets `--install-strategy=nested`




#### `global-style`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=shallow`

Only install direct dependencies in the top level `node_modules`, but hoist
on deeper dependencies
 Sets `--install-strategy=shallow`




#### `omit`

* Default: 'dev' if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to
  'production', otherwise empty

* Type: ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk


Note that these dependencies _are_ still resolved and added to the
`package-lock
json` or `npm-shrinkwrap
json` file
 They are just not
physically installed on disk


If a package type appears in both the `--include` and `--omit` lists, then
it will be included


If the resulting omit list includes `'dev'`, then the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable will be set to `'production'` for all lifecycle scripts




#### `include`

* Default:
* Type: ""prod"", ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Option that allows for defining which types of dependencies to install


This is the inverse of `--omit=<type>`


Dependency types specified in `--include` will not be omitted, regardless of
the order in which omit/include are specified on the command-line




#### `strict-peer-deps`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to `true`, and `--legacy-peer-deps` is not set, then _any_
conflicting `peerDependencies` will be treated as an install failure, even
if npm could reasonably guess the appropriate resolution based on non-peer
dependency relationships


By default, conflicting `peerDependencies` deep in the dependency graph will
be resolved using the nearest non-peer dependency specification, even if
doing so will result in some packages receiving a peer dependency outside
the range set in their package's `peerDependencies` object


When such an override is performed, a warning is printed, explaining the
conflict and the packages involved
 If `--strict-peer-deps` is set, then
this warning is treated as a failure




#### `package-lock`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

If set to false, then ignore `package-lock
json` files when installing
 This
will also prevent _writing_ `package-lock
json` if `save` is true




#### `foreground-scripts`

* Default: `false` unless when using `npm pack` or `npm publish` where it
  defaults to `true`
* Type: Boolean

Run all build scripts (ie, `preinstall`, `install`, and `postinstall`)
scripts for installed packages in the foreground process, sharing standard
input, output, and error with the main npm process


Note that this will generally make installs run slower, and be much noisier,
but can be useful for debugging




#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package
json files


Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they
will *not* run any pre- or post-scripts




#### `audit`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When ""true"" submit audit reports alongside the current npm command to the
default registry and all registries configured for scopes
 See the
documentation for [`npm audit`](/commands/npm-audit) for details on what is
submitted




#### `bin-links`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Tells npm to create symlinks (or `
cmd` shims on Windows) for package
executables


Set to false to have it not do this




#### `fund`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When ""true"" displays the message at the end of each `npm install`
acknowledging the number of dependencies looking for funding
 See [`npm
fund`](/commands/npm-fund) for details




#### `dry-run`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done
 This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, `install`, `update`,
`dedupe`, `uninstall`, as well as `pack` and `publish`


Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg `dist-tags`,
`owner`, etc




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `install-links`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When set file: protocol dependencies will be packed and installed as regular
dependencies instead of creating a symlink
 This option has no effect on
workspaces

section: 1
description: Bump a package version
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm version [<newversion> | major | minor | patch | premajor | preminor | prepatch | prerelease | from-git]

alias: verison
```

### Configuration

#### `allow-same-version`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Prevents throwing an error when `npm version` is used to set the new version
to the same value as the current version




#### `commit-hooks`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Run git commit hooks when using the `npm version` command




#### `git-tag-version`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Tag the commit when using the `npm version` command
 Setting this to false
results in no commit being made at all




#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output


* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON
parse() before
  saving them to your `package
json`


Not supported by all npm commands




#### `preid`

* Default: """"
* Type: String

The ""prerelease identifier"" to use as a prefix for the ""prerelease"" part of
a semver
 Like the `rc` in `1
2
0-rc
8`




#### `sign-git-tag`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to true, then the `npm version` command will tag the version using
`-s` to add a signature


Note that git requires you to have set up GPG keys in your git configs for
this to work properly




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces-update`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

If set to true, the npm cli will run an update after operations that may
possibly change the workspaces installed to the `node_modules` folder




#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


### Description

Run this in a package directory to bump the version and write the new data
back to `package
json`, `package-lock
json`, and, if present,
`npm-shrinkwrap
json`


The `newversion` argument should be a valid semver string, a valid second
argument to [semver
inc](https://github
com/npm/node-semver#functions) (one
of `patch`, `minor`, `major`, `prepatch`, `preminor`, `premajor`,
`prerelease`), or `from-git`
 In the second case, the existing version will
be incremented by 1 in the specified field
  `from-git` will try to read
the latest git tag, and use that as the new npm version


If run in a git repo, it will also create a version commit and tag
  This
behavior is controlled by `git-tag-version` (see below), and can be
disabled on the command line by running `npm --no-git-tag-version version`

It will fail if the working directory is not clean, unless the `-f` or
`--force` flag is set


If supplied with `-m` or [`--message` config](/using-npm/config#message) option,
npm will use it as a commit message when creating a version commit
  If the
`message` config contains `%s` then that will be replaced with the resulting
version number
 For example:

```bash
npm version patch -m ""Upgrade to %s for reasons""
```

If the [`sign-git-tag` config](/using-npm/config#sign-git-tag) is set, then the
tag will be signed using the `-s` flag to git
 Note that you must have a default
GPG key set up in your git config for this to work properly
 For example:

```bash
$ npm config set sign-git-tag true
$ npm version patch

You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: ""isaacs (http://blog
izs
me/) <i@izs
me>""
2048-bit RSA key, ID 6C481CF6, created 2010-08-31

Enter passphrase:
```

If `preversion`, `version`, or `postversion` are in the `scripts` property
of the package
json, they will be executed as part of running `npm
version`


The exact order of execution is as follows:

1
 Check to make sure the git working directory is clean before we get
   started
  Your scripts may add files to the commit in future steps

   This step is skipped if the `--force` flag is set

2
 Run the `preversion` script
 These scripts have access to the old
   `version` in package
json
  A typical use would be running your full
   test suite before deploying
  Any files you want added to the commit
   should be explicitly added using `git add`

3
 Bump `version` in `package
json` as requested (`patch`, `minor`,
   `major`, etc)

4
 Run the `version` script
 These scripts have access to the new `version`
   in package
json (so they can incorporate it into file headers in
   generated files for example)
  Again, scripts should explicitly add
   generated files to the commit using `git add`

5
 Commit and tag

6
 Run the `postversion` script
 Use it to clean up the file system or
   automatically push the commit and/or tag


Take the following example:

```json
{
  ""scripts"": {
    ""preversion"": ""npm test"",
    ""version"": ""npm run build && git add -A dist"",
    ""postversion"": ""git push && git push --tags && rm -rf build/temp""
  }
}
```

This runs all your tests and proceeds only if they pass
 Then runs your
`build` script, and adds everything in the `dist` directory to the commit

After the commit, it pushes the new commit and tag up to the server, and
deletes the `build/temp` directory

title: npm-view
section: 1
description: View registry info
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm view [<package-spec>] [<field>[
subfield]


]

aliases: info, show, v
```

### Description

This command shows data about a package and prints it to stdout


As an example, to view information about the `connect` package from the registry, you would run:

```bash
npm view connect
```

The default version is `""latest""` if unspecified


Field names can be specified after the package descriptor

For example, to show the dependencies of the `ronn` package at version
`0
3
5`, you could do the following:

```bash
npm view ronn@0
3
5 dependencies
```

By default, `npm view` shows data about the current project context (by looking for a `package
json`)

To show field data for the current project use a file path (i
e
 `
`):

```bash
npm view 
 dependencies
```

You can view child fields by separating them with a period

To view the git repository URL for the latest version of `npm`, you would run the following command:

```bash
npm view npm repository
url
```

This makes it easy to view information about a dependency with a bit of
shell scripting
 For example, to view all the data about the version of
`opts` that `ronn` depends on, you could write the following:

```bash
npm view opts@$(npm view ronn dependencies
opts)
```

For fields that are arrays, requesting a non-numeric field will return
all of the values from the objects in the list
 For example, to get all
the contributor email addresses for the `express` package, you would run:

```bash
npm view express contributors
email
```

You may also use numeric indices in square braces to specifically select
an item in an array field
 To just get the email address of the first
contributor in the list, you can run:

```bash
npm view express contributors[0]
8
0]'
```

Multiple fields may be specified, and will be printed one after another

For example, to get all the contributor names and email addresses, you
can do this:

```bash
npm view express contributors
name contributors
email
```

""Person"" fields are shown as a string if they would be shown as an
object
  So, for example, this will show the list of `npm` contributors in
the shortened string format
  (See [`package
json`](/configuring-npm/package-json) for more on this
)

```bash
npm view npm contributors
```

If a version range is provided, then data will be printed for every
matching version of the package
5
4' dependencies
jsdom
```

To show the `connect` package version history, you can do
this:

```bash
npm view connect versions
```

### Configuration

#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output


* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON
parse() before
  saving them to your `package
json`


Not supported by all npm commands




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


### Output

If only a single string field for a single version is output, then it
will not be colorized or quoted, to enable piping the output to
another command
 If the field is an object, it will be output as a JavaScript object literal


If the `--json` flag is given, the outputted fields will be JSON


If the version range matches multiple versions then each printed value
will be prefixed with the version it applies to


If multiple fields are requested, then each of them is prefixed with
the field name

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Description

Display the npm username of the currently logged-in user


If logged into a registry that provides token-based authentication, then
connect to the `/-/whoami` registry endpoint to find the username
associated with the token, and print to standard output


If logged into a registry that uses Basic Auth, then simply print the
`username` portion of the authentication string


### Configuration

#### `registry`

* Default: ""https://registry
npmjs
org/""
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry

title: npm
section: 1
description: javascript package manager
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces


### Version

10
5
2

### Description

npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform
  It puts
modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency
conflicts intelligently


It is extremely configurable to support a variety of use cases
  Most
commonly, you use it to publish, discover, install, and develop node
programs


Run `npm help` to get a list of available commands


### Important

npm comes preconfigured to use npm's public registry at
https://registry
npmjs
org by default
 Use of the npm public registry is
subject to terms of use available at
https://docs
npmjs
com/policies/terms


You can configure npm to use any compatible registry you like, and even
run your own registry
 Use of someone else's registry is governed by
their terms of use


### Introduction

You probably got npm because you want to install stuff


The very first thing you will most likely want to run in any node
program is `npm install` to install its dependencies


You can also run `npm install blerg` to install the latest version of
""blerg""
  Check out [`npm install`](/commands/npm-install) for more
info
  It can do a lot of stuff


Use the `npm search` command to show everything that's available in the
public registry
  Use `npm ls` to show everything you've installed


### Dependencies

If a package lists a dependency using a git URL, npm will install that
dependency using the [`git`](https://github
com/git-guides/install-git)
command and will generate an error if it is not installed


If one of the packages npm tries to install is a native node module and
requires compiling of C++ Code, npm will use
[node-gyp](https://github
com/nodejs/node-gyp) for that task

For a Unix system, [node-gyp](https://github
com/nodejs/node-gyp)
needs Python, make and a buildchain like GCC
 On Windows,
Python and Microsoft Visual Studio C++ are needed
 For more information
visit [the node-gyp repository](https://github
com/nodejs/node-gyp) and
the [node-gyp Wiki](https://github
com/nodejs/node-gyp/wiki)


### Directories

See [`folders`](/configuring-npm/folders) to learn about where npm puts
stuff


In particular, npm has two modes of operation:

* local mode:
  npm installs packages into the current project directory, which
  defaults to the current working directory
  Packages install to
  `
/node_modules`, and bins to `
/node_modules/
bin`

* global mode:
  npm installs packages into the install prefix at
  `$npm_config_prefix/lib/node_modules` and bins to
  `$npm_config_prefix/bin`


Local mode is the default


### Developer Usage

If you're using npm to develop and publish your code, check out the
following help topics:

* json:
  Make a package
json file
  See
  [`package
json`](/configuring-npm/package-json)

* link:
  Links your current working code into Node's path, so that you don't
  have to reinstall every time you make a change
  Use [`npm
  link`](/commands/npm-link) to do this

* install:
  It's a good idea to install things if you don't need the symbolic
  link
  Especially, installing other peoples code from the registry is
  done via [`npm install`](/commands/npm-install)
* adduser:
  Create an account or log in
  When you do this, npm will store
  credentials in the user config file

* publish:
  Use the [`npm publish`](/commands/npm-publish) command to upload your
  code to the registry


#### Configuration

npm is extremely configurable
  It reads its configuration options from
5 places


* Command line switches:
  Set a config with `--key val`
  All keys take a value, even if they
  are booleans (the config parser doesn't know what the options are at
  the time of parsing)
  If you do not provide a value (`--key`) then
  the option is set to boolean `true`

* Environment Variables:
  Set any config by prefixing the name in an environment variable with
  `npm_config_`
  For example, `export npm_config_key=val`

* User Configs:
  The file at `$HOME/
npmrc` is an ini-formatted list of configs
  If
  present, it is parsed
  If the `userconfig` option is set in the cli
  or env, that file will be used instead

* Global Configs:
  The file found at `
/etc/npmrc` (relative to the global prefix will be
  parsed if it is found
  See [`npm prefix`](/commands/npm-prefix) for
  more info on the global prefix
  If the `globalconfig` option is set
  in the cli, env, or user config, then that file is parsed instead

* Defaults:
  npm's default configuration options are defined in
  `lib/utils/config/definitions
js`

title: npx
section: 1
description: Run a command from a local or remote npm package
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npx -- <pkg>[@<version>] [args


]
npx --package=<pkg>[@<version>] -- <cmd> [args


]
npx -c '<cmd> [args


]'
npx --package=foo -c '<cmd> [args


]'
```

### Description

This command allows you to run an arbitrary command from an npm package
(either one installed locally, or fetched remotely), in a similar context
as running it via `npm run`


Whatever packages are specified by the `--package` option will be
provided in the `PATH` of the executed command, along with any locally
installed package executables
  The `--package` option may be
specified multiple times, to execute the supplied command in an environment
where all specified packages are available


If any requested packages are not present in the local project
dependencies, then they are installed to a folder in the npm cache, which
is added to the `PATH` environment variable in the executed process
  A
prompt is printed (which can be suppressed by providing either `--yes` or
`--no`)


Package names provided without a specifier will be matched with whatever
version exists in the local project
  Package names with a specifier will
only be considered a match if they have the exact same name and version as
the local dependency


If no `-c` or `--call` option is provided, then the positional arguments
are used to generate the command string
  If no `--package` options
are provided, then npm will attempt to determine the executable name from
the package specifier provided as the first positional argument according
to the following heuristic:

- If the package has a single entry in its `bin` field in `package
json`,
  or if all entries are aliases of the same command, then that command
  will be used

- If the package has multiple `bin` entries, and one of them matches the
  unscoped portion of the `name` field, then that command will be used

- If this does not result in exactly one option (either because there are
  no bin entries, or none of them match the `name` of the package), then
  `npm exec` exits with an error


To run a binary _other than_ the named binary, specify one or more
`--package` options, which will prevent npm from inferring the package from
the first command argument


### `npx` vs `npm exec`

When run via the `npx` binary, all flags and options *must* be set prior to
any positional arguments
  When run via `npm exec`, a double-hyphen `--`
flag can be used to suppress npm's parsing of switches and options that
should be sent to the executed command


For example:

```
$ npx foo@latest bar --package=@npmcli/foo
```

In this case, npm will resolve the `foo` package name, and run the
following command:

```
$ foo bar --package=@npmcli/foo
```

Since the `--package` option comes _after_ the positional arguments, it is
treated as an argument to the executed command


In contrast, due to npm's argument parsing logic, running this command is
different:

```
$ npm exec foo@latest bar --package=@npmcli/foo
```

In this case, npm will parse the `--package` option first, resolving the
`@npmcli/foo` package
  Then, it will execute the following command in that
context:

```
$ foo@latest bar
```

The double-hyphen character is recommended to explicitly tell npm to stop
parsing command line options and switches
  The following command would
thus be equivalent to the `npx` command above:

```
$ npm exec -- foo@latest bar --package=@npmcli/foo
```

### Examples

Run the version of `tap` in the local dependencies, with the provided
arguments:

```
$ npm exec -- tap --bail test/foo
js
$ npx tap --bail test/foo
js
```

Run a command _other than_ the command whose name matches the package name
by specifying a `--package` option:

```
$ npm exec --package=foo -- bar --bar-argument
# ~ or ~
$ npx --package=foo bar --bar-argument
```

Run an arbitrary shell script, in the context of the current project:

```
$ npm x -c 'eslint && say ""hooray, lint passed""'
$ npx -c 'eslint && say ""hooray, lint passed""'
```

### Compatibility with Older npx Versions

The `npx` binary was rewritten in npm v7
0
0, and the standalone `npx`
package deprecated at that time
  `npx` uses the `npm exec`
command instead of a separate argument parser and install process, with
some affordances to maintain backwards compatibility with the arguments it
accepted in previous versions


This resulted in some shifts in its functionality:

- Any `npm` config value may be provided

- To prevent security and user-experience problems from mistyping package
  names, `npx` prompts before installing anything
  Suppress this
  prompt with the `-y` or `--yes` option

- The `--no-install` option is deprecated, and will be converted to `--no`

- Shell fallback functionality is removed, as it is not advisable

- The `-p` argument is a shorthand for `--parseable` in npm, but shorthand
  for `--package` in npx
  This is maintained, but only for the `npx`
  executable

- The `--ignore-existing` option is removed
  Locally installed bins are
  always present in the executed process `PATH`

- The `--npm` option is removed
  `npx` will always use the `npm` it ships
  with

- The `--node-arg` and `-n` options have been removed
 Use [`NODE_OPTIONS`](https://nodejs
org/api/cli
html#node_optionsoptions) instead: e
g
,
 `NODE_OPTIONS=""--trace-warnings --trace-exit"" npx foo --random=true`
- The `--always-spawn` option is redundant, and thus removed

- The `--shell` option is replaced with `--script-shell`, but maintained
  in the `npx` executable for backwards compatibility

title: folders
section: 5
description: Folder Structures Used by npm
---

### Description

npm puts various things on your computer
  That's its job


This document will tell you what it puts where


#### tl;dr

* Local install (default): puts stuff in `
/node_modules` of the current
  package root

* Global install (with `-g`): puts stuff in /usr/local or wherever node
  is installed

* Install it **locally** if you're going to `require()` it

* Install it **globally** if you're going to run it on the command line

* If you need both, then install it in both places, or use `npm link`


#### prefix Configuration

The [`prefix` config](/using-npm/config#prefix) defaults to the location where
node is installed
 On most systems, this is `/usr/local`
 On Windows, it's
`%AppData%\npm`
 On Unix systems, it's one level up, since node is typically
installed at `{prefix}/bin/node` rather than `{prefix}/node
exe`


When the `global` flag is set, npm installs things into this prefix

When it is not set, it uses the root of the current package, or the
current working directory if not in a package already


#### Node Modules

Packages are dropped into the `node_modules` folder under the `prefix`

When installing locally, this means that you can
`require(""packagename"")` to load its main module, or
`require(""packagename/lib/path/to/sub/module"")` to load other modules


Global installs on Unix systems go to `{prefix}/lib/node_modules`

Global installs on Windows go to `{prefix}/node_modules` (that is, no
`lib` folder
)

Scoped packages are installed the same way, except they are grouped together
in a sub-folder of the relevant `node_modules` folder with the name of that
scope prefix by the @ symbol, e
g
 `npm install @myorg/package` would place
the package in `{prefix}/node_modules/@myorg/package`
 See
[`scope`](/using-npm/scope) for more details


If you wish to `require()` a package, then install it locally


#### Executables

When in global mode, executables are linked into `{prefix}/bin` on Unix,
or directly into `{prefix}` on Windows
  Ensure that path is in your
terminal's `PATH` environment to run them


When in local mode, executables are linked into
`
/node_modules/
bin` so that they can be made available to scripts run
through npm
  (For example, so that a test runner will be in the path
when you run `npm test`
)

#### Man Pages

When in global mode, man pages are linked into `{prefix}/share/man`


When in local mode, man pages are not installed


Man pages are not installed on Windows systems


#### Cache

See [`npm cache`](/commands/npm-cache)
  Cache files are stored in `~/
npm` on Posix, or
`%LocalAppData%/npm-cache` on Windows


This is controlled by the [`cache` config](/using-npm/config#cache) param


#### Temp Files

Temporary files are stored by default in the folder specified by the
[`tmp` config](/using-npm/config#tmp), which defaults to the TMPDIR, TMP, or
TEMP environment variables, or `/tmp` on Unix and `c:\windows\temp` on Windows


Temp files are given a unique folder under this root for each run of the
program, and are deleted upon successful exit


### More Information

When installing locally, npm first tries to find an appropriate
`prefix` folder
  This is so that `npm install foo@1
2
3` will install
to the sensible root of your package, even if you happen to have `cd`ed
into some other folder


Starting at the $PWD, npm will walk up the folder tree checking for a
folder that contains either a `package
json` file, or a `node_modules`
folder
  If such a thing is found, then that is treated as the effective
""current directory"" for the purpose of running npm commands
git-folder seeking
logic when running git commands in a working dir
)

If no package root is found, then the current folder is used


When you run `npm install foo@1
2
3`, then the package is loaded into
the cache, and then unpacked into `
/node_modules/foo`
  Then, any of
foo's dependencies are similarly unpacked into
`
/node_modules/foo/node_modules/


`
/node_modules/
bin/`, so that they may
be found by npm scripts when necessary


#### Global Installation

If the [`global` config](/using-npm/config#global) is set to true, then npm will
install packages ""globally""


For global installation, packages are installed roughly the same way,
but using the folders described above


#### Cycles, Conflicts, and Folder Parsimony

Cycles are handled using the property of node's module system that it
walks up the directories looking for `node_modules` folders
  So, at every
stage, if a package is already installed in an ancestor `node_modules`
folder, then it is not installed at the current location


Consider the case above, where `foo -> bar -> baz`
  Imagine if, in
addition to that, baz depended on bar, so you'd have:
`foo -> bar -> baz -> bar -> baz 


`
  However, since the folder
structure is: `foo/node_modules/bar/node_modules/baz`, there's no need to
put another copy of bar into `


/baz/node_modules`, since when baz calls
`require(""bar"")`, it will get the copy that is installed in
`foo/node_modules/bar`


This shortcut is only used if the exact same
version would be installed in multiple nested `node_modules` folders
  It
is still possible to have `a/node_modules/b/node_modules/a` if the two
""a"" packages are different versions
  However, without repeating the
exact same package multiple times, an infinite regress will always be
prevented


Another optimization can be made by installing dependencies at the
highest level possible, below the localized ""target"" folder (hoisting)

Since version 3, npm hoists dependencies by default


#### Example

Consider this dependency graph:

```bash
foo
+-- blerg@1
2
5
+-- bar@1
2
3
|   +-- blerg@1
x (latest=1
3
7)
|   +-- baz@2
x
|   |   `-- quux@3
x
|   |       `-- bar@1
2
3 (cycle)
|   `-- asdf@*
`-- baz@1
2
3
    `-- quux@3
x
        `-- bar
```

In this case, we might expect a folder structure like this
(with all dependencies hoisted to the highest level possible):

```bash
foo
+-- node_modules
    +-- blerg (1
2
5) <---[A]
    +-- bar (1
2
3) <---[B]
    |   +-- node_modules
    |       +-- baz (2
0
2) <---[C]
    +-- asdf (2
3
4)
    +-- baz (1
2
3) <---[D]
    +-- quux (3
2
0) <---[E]
```

Since foo depends directly on `bar@1
2
3` and `baz@1
2
3`, those are
installed in foo's `node_modules` folder


Even though the latest copy of blerg is 1
3
7, foo has a specific
dependency on version 1
2
5
  So, that gets installed at [A]
  Since the
parent installation of blerg satisfies bar's dependency on `blerg@1
x`,
it does not install another copy under [B]


Bar [B] also has dependencies on baz and asdf
  Because it depends on `baz@2
x`, it cannot
re-use the `baz@1
2
3` installed in the parent `node_modules` folder [D],
and must install its own copy [C]
 In order to minimize duplication, npm hoists
dependencies to the top level by default, so asdf is installed under [A]


Underneath bar, the `baz -> quux -> bar` dependency creates a cycle

However, because bar is already in quux's ancestry [B], it does not
unpack another copy of bar into that folder
 Likewise, quux's [E]
folder tree is empty, because its dependency on bar is satisfied
by the parent folder copy installed at [B]


For a graphical breakdown of what is installed where, use `npm ls`


#### Publishing

Upon publishing, npm will look in the `node_modules` folder
  If any of
the items there are not in the `bundleDependencies` array, then they will
not be included in the package tarball


This allows a package maintainer to install all of their dependencies
(and dev dependencies) locally, but only re-publish those items that
cannot be found elsewhere
  See [`package
json`](/configuring-npm/package-json) for more information

title: install
section: 5
description: Download and install node and npm
---

### Description

To publish and install packages to and from the public npm registry, you
must install Node
js and the npm command line interface using either a Node
version manager or a Node installer
 **We strongly recommend using a Node
version manager to install Node
js and npm
** We do not recommend using a
Node installer, since the Node installation process installs npm in a
directory with local permissions and can cause permissions errors when you
run npm packages globally


### Overview

- [Checking your version of npm and
  Node
js](#checking-your-version-of-npm-and-nodejs)
- [Using a Node version manager to install Node
js and
  npm](#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm)
- [Using a Node installer to install Node
js and
  npm](#using-a-node-installer-to-install-nodejs-and-npm)

### Checking your version of npm and Node
js

To see if you already have Node
js and npm installed and check the
installed version, run the following commands:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

### Using a Node version manager to install Node
js and npm

Node version managers allow you to install and switch between multiple
versions of Node
js and npm on your system so you can test your
applications on multiple versions of npm to ensure they work for users on
different versions
  You can
[search for them on GitHub](https://github
com/search?q=node+version+manager+archived%3Afalse&type=repositories&ref=advsearch)


### Using a Node installer to install Node
js and npm

If you are unable to use a Node version manager, you can use a Node
installer to install both Node
js and npm on your system


* [Node
js installer](https://nodejs
org/en/download/)
* [NodeSource installer](https://github
com/nodesource/distributions)
 If
  you use Linux, we recommend that you use a NodeSource installer


#### OS X or Windows Node installers

If you're using OS X or Windows, use one of the installers from the
[Node
js download page](https://nodejs
org/en/download/)
 Be sure to
install the version labeled **LTS**
 Other versions have not yet been
tested with npm


#### Linux or other operating systems Node installers

If you're using Linux or another operating system, use one of the following
installers:

- [NodeSource installer](https://github
com/nodesource/distributions)
  (recommended)
- One of the installers on the [Node
js download
  page](https://nodejs
org/en/download/)

Or see [this page](https://nodejs
org/en/download/package-manager/) to
install npm for Linux in the way many Linux developers prefer


#### Less-common operating systems

For more information on installing Node
js on a variety of operating
systems, see [this page][pkg-mgr]

title: npm-shrinkwrap
json
section: 5
description: A publishable lockfile
---

### Description

`npm-shrinkwrap
json` is a file created by [`npm
shrinkwrap`](/commands/npm-shrinkwrap)
 It is identical to
`package-lock
json`, with one major caveat: Unlike `package-lock
json`,
`npm-shrinkwrap
json` may be included when publishing a package


The recommended use-case for `npm-shrinkwrap
json` is applications deployed
through the publishing process on the registry: for example, daemons and
command-line tools intended as global installs or `devDependencies`
 It's
strongly discouraged for library authors to publish this file, since that
would prevent end users from having control over transitive dependency
updates


If both `package-lock
json` and `npm-shrinkwrap
json` are present in a
package root, `npm-shrinkwrap
json` will be preferred over the
`package-lock
json` file


For full details and description of the `npm-shrinkwrap
json` file format,
refer to the manual page for
[package-lock
json](/configuring-npm/package-lock-json)

title: npmrc
section: 5
description: The npm config files
---

### Description

npm gets its config settings from the command line, environment variables,
and `npmrc` files


The `npm config` command can be used to update and edit the contents of the
user and global npmrc files


For a list of available configuration options, see
[config](/using-npm/config)


### Files

The four relevant files are:

* per-project config file (`/path/to/my/project/
npmrc`)
* per-user config file (`~/
npmrc`)
* global config file (`$PREFIX/etc/npmrc`)
* npm builtin config file (`/path/to/npm/npmrc`)

All npm config files are an ini-formatted list of `key = value` parameters

Environment variables can be replaced using `${VARIABLE_NAME}`
 For
example:

```bash
prefix = ${HOME}/
npm-packages
```

Each of these files is loaded, and config options are resolved in priority
order
  For example, a setting in the userconfig file would override the
setting in the globalconfig file


Array values are specified by adding ""[]"" after the key name
 For example:

```bash
key[] = ""first value""
key[] = ""second value""
```

#### Comments

Lines in `
npmrc` files are interpreted as comments when they begin with a
`;` or `#` character
 `
npmrc` files are parsed by
[npm/ini](https://github
com/npm/ini), which specifies this comment syntax


For example:

```bash
# last modified: 01 Jan 2016
; Set a new registry for a scoped package
@myscope:registry=https://mycustomregistry
example
org
```

#### Per-project config file

When working locally in a project, a `
npmrc` file in the root of the
project (ie, a sibling of `node_modules` and `package
json`) will set
config values specific to this project


Note that this only applies to the root of the project that you're running
npm in
  It has no effect when your module is published
  For example, you
can't publish a module that forces itself to install globally, or in a
different location


Additionally, this file is not read in global mode, such as when running
`npm install -g`


#### Per-user config file

`$HOME/
npmrc` (or the `userconfig` param, if set in the environment or on
the command line)

#### Global config file

`$PREFIX/etc/npmrc` (or the `globalconfig` param, if set above): This file
is an ini-file formatted list of `key = value` parameters
  Environment
variables can be replaced as above


#### Built-in config file

`path/to/npm/itself/npmrc`

This is an unchangeable ""builtin"" configuration file that npm keeps
consistent across updates
  Set fields in here using the `
/configure`
script that comes with npm
  This is primarily for distribution maintainers
to override default configs in a standard and consistent manner


### Auth related configuration

The settings `_auth`, `_authToken`, `username` and `_password` must all be
scoped to a specific registry
 This ensures that `npm` will never send
credentials to the wrong host


The full list is:
 - `_auth` (base64 authentication string)
 - `_authToken` (authentication token)
 - `username`
 - `_password`
 - `email`
 - `certfile` (path to certificate file)
 - `keyfile` (path to key file)

In order to scope these values, they must be prefixed by a URI fragment

If the credential is meant for any request to a registry on a single host,
the scope may look like `//registry
npmjs
org/:`
 If it must be scoped to a
specific path on the host that path may also be provided, such as
`//my-custom-registry


```
; bad config
_authToken=MYTOKEN

; good config
@myorg:registry=https://somewhere-else
com/myorg
@another:registry=https://somewhere-else
com/another
//registry
npmjs
org/:_authToken=MYTOKEN
; would apply to both @myorg and @another
; //somewhere-else
com/:_authToken=MYTOKEN
; would apply only to @myorg
//somewhere-else
com/myorg/:_authToken=MYTOKEN1
; would apply only to @another
//somewhere-else
com/another/:_authToken=MYTOKEN2
```

title: package
json
section: 5
description: Specifics of npm's package
json handling
---

### Description

This document is all you need to know about what's required in your
package
json file
  It must be actual JSON, not just a JavaScript object
literal


### name

If you plan to publish your package, the *most* important things in your
package
json are the name and version fields as they will be required
 The
name and version together form an identifier that is assumed to be
completely unique
  Changes to the package should come along with changes
to the version
 If you don't plan to publish your package, the name and
version fields are optional


The name is what your thing is called


Some rules:

* The name must be less than or equal to 214 characters
 This includes the
  scope for scoped packages

* The names of scoped packages can begin with a dot or an underscore
 This
  is not permitted without a scope

* New packages must not have uppercase letters in the name

* The name ends up being part of a URL, an argument on the command line,
  and a folder name


Some tips:

* Don't use the same name as a core Node module

* Don't put ""js"" or ""node"" in the name
json file, and you can specify the engine using
  the ""[engines](#engines)"" field
  (See below
)
* The name will probably be passed as an argument to require(), so it
  should be something short, but also reasonably descriptive

* You may want to check the npm registry to see if there's something by
  that name already, before you get too attached to it

  <https://www
npmjs
com/>

A name can be optionally prefixed by a scope, e
g
 `@myorg/mypackage`
 See
[`scope`](/using-npm/scope) for more detail


### version

If you plan to publish your package, the *most* important things in your
package
json are the name and version fields as they will be required
 The
name and version together form an identifier that is assumed to be
completely unique
  Changes to the package should come along with changes
to the version
 If you don't plan to publish your package, the name and
version fields are optional


Version must be parseable by
[node-semver](https://github
com/npm/node-semver), which is bundled with
npm as a dependency
  (`npm install semver` to use it yourself
)

### description

Put a description in it
  This helps people discover your
package, as it's listed in `npm search`


### keywords

Put keywords in it
  It's an array of strings
  This helps people discover
your package as it's listed in `npm search`


### homepage

The URL to the project homepage


Example:

```json
""homepage"": ""https://github
com/owner/project#readme""
```

### bugs

The URL to your project's issue tracker and / or the email address to which
issues should be reported
 These are helpful for people who encounter
issues with your package


It should look like this:

```json
{
  ""bugs"": {
    ""url"": ""https://github
com/owner/project/issues"",
    ""email"": ""project@hostname
com""
  }
}
```

You can specify either one or both values
 If you want to provide only a
URL, you can specify the value for ""bugs"" as a simple string instead of an
object


If a URL is provided, it will be used by the `npm bugs` command


### license

You should specify a license for your package so that people know how they
are permitted to use it, and any restrictions you're placing on it


If you're using a common license such as BSD-2-Clause or MIT, add a current
SPDX license identifier for the license you're using, like this:

```json
{
  ""license"" : ""BSD-3-Clause""
}
```

You can check [the full list of SPDX license
IDs](https://spdx
org/licenses/)
  Ideally you should pick one that is
[OSI](https://opensource
org/licenses/) approved


If your package is licensed under multiple common licenses, use an [SPDX
license expression syntax version 2
0
string](https://spdx
dev/specifications/), like this:

```json
{
  ""license"" : ""(ISC OR GPL-3
0)""
}
```
If you are using a license that hasn't been assigned an SPDX identifier, or if
you are using a custom license, use a string value like this one:

```json
{
  ""license"" : ""SEE LICENSE IN <filename>""
}
```
Then include a file named `<filename>` at the top level of the package


Some old packages used license objects or a ""licenses"" property containing
an array of license objects:

```json
// Not valid metadata
{
  ""license"" : {
    ""type"" : ""ISC"",
    ""url"" : ""https://opensource
org/licenses/ISC""
  }
}

// Not valid metadata
{
  ""licenses"" : [
    {
      ""type"": ""MIT"",
      ""url"": ""https://www
opensource
org/licenses/mit-license
php""
    },
    {
      ""type"": ""Apache-2
0"",
      ""url"": ""https://opensource
org/licenses/apache2
0
php""
    }
  ]
}
```

Those styles are now deprecated
 Instead, use SPDX expressions, like this:

```json
{
  ""license"": ""ISC""
}
```

```json
{
  ""license"": ""(MIT OR Apache-2
0)""
}
```

Finally, if you do not wish to grant others the right to use a private or
unpublished package under any terms:

```json
{
  ""license"": ""UNLICENSED""
}
```

Consider also setting `""private"": true` to prevent accidental publication


### people fields: author, contributors

The ""author"" is one person
  ""contributors"" is an array of people
  A
""person"" is an object with a ""name"" field and optionally ""url"" and ""email"",
like this:

```json
{
  ""name"" : ""Barney Rubble"",
  ""email"" : ""b@rubble
com"",
  ""url"" : ""http://barnyrubble
tumblr
com/""
}
```

Or you can shorten that all into a single string, and npm will parse it for
you:

```json
{
  ""author"": ""Barney Rubble <b@rubble
com> (http://barnyrubble
tumblr
com/)""
}
```

Both email and url are optional either way


npm also sets a top-level ""maintainers"" field with your npm user info


### funding

You can specify an object containing a URL that provides up-to-date
information about ways to help fund development of your package, or a
string URL, or an array of these:

```json
{
  ""funding"": {
    ""type"" : ""individual"",
    ""url"" : ""http://example
com/donate""
  },

  ""funding"": {
    ""type"" : ""patreon"",
    ""url"" : ""https://www
patreon
com/my-account""
  },

  ""funding"": ""http://example
com/donate"",

  ""funding"": [
    {
      ""type"" : ""individual"",
      ""url"" : ""http://example
com/donate""
    },
    ""http://example
com/donateAlso"",
    {
      ""type"" : ""patreon"",
      ""url"" : ""https://www
patreon
com/my-account""
    }
  ]
}
```

Users can use the `npm fund` subcommand to list the `funding` URLs of all
dependencies of their project, direct and indirect
 A shortcut to visit
each funding url is also available when providing the project name such as:
`npm fund <projectname>` (when there are multiple URLs, the first one will
be visited)

### files

The optional `files` field is an array of file patterns that describes the
entries to be included when your package is installed as a dependency
 File
patterns follow a similar syntax to `
 Omitting the field
will make it default to `[""*""]`, which means it will include all files


You can also provide a `
npmignore` file in the root of your package or in
subdirectories, which will keep files from being included
 At the root of
your package it will not override the ""files"" field, but in subdirectories
it will
 The `
npmignore` file works just like a `
gitignore`
 If there is
a `
gitignore` file, and `
npmignore` is missing, `
gitignore`'s contents
will be used instead


Certain files are always included, regardless of settings:

* `package
json`
* `README`
* `LICENSE` / `LICENCE`
* The file in the ""main"" field
* The file(s) in the ""bin"" field

`README` & `LICENSE` can have any case and extension


Some files are always ignored by default:

* `*
orig`
* `
*
swp`
* `
DS_Store`
* `
_*`
* `
git`
* `
hg`
* `
lock-wscript`
* `
npmrc`
* `
svn`
* `
wafpickle-N`
* `CVS`
* `config
gypi`
* `node_modules`
* `npm-debug
log`
* `package-lock
json` (use
  [`npm-shrinkwrap
json`](/configuring-npm/npm-shrinkwrap-json)
  if you wish it to be published)
* `pnpm-lock
yaml`
* `yarn
lock`

Most of these ignored files can be included specifically if included in
the `files` globs
  Exceptions to this are:

* `
git`
* `
npmrc`
* `node_modules`
* `package-lock
json`
* `pnpm-lock
yaml`
* `yarn
lock`

These can not be included


### main

The main field is a module ID that is the primary entry point to your
program
  That is, if your package is named `foo`, and a user installs it,
and then does `require(""foo"")`, then your main module's exports object will
be returned


This should be a module relative to the root of your package folder


For most modules, it makes the most sense to have a main script and often
not much else


If `main` is not set, it defaults to `index
js` in the package's root folder


### browser

If your module is meant to be used client-side the browser field should be
used instead of the main field
 This is helpful to hint users that it might
rely on primitives that aren't available in Node
js modules
 (e
g

`window`)

### bin

A lot of packages have one or more executable files that they'd like to
install into the PATH
 npm makes this pretty easy (in fact, it uses this
feature to install the ""npm"" executable
)

To use this, supply a `bin` field in your package
json which is a map of
command name to local file name
 When this package is installed globally,
that file will be either linked inside the global bins directory or
a cmd (Windows Command File) will be created which executes the specified
file in the `bin` field, so it is available to run by `name` or `name
cmd` (on
Windows PowerShell)
 When this package is installed as a dependency in another
package, the file will be linked where it will be available to that package
either directly by `npm exec` or by name in other scripts when invoking them
via `npm run-script`



For example, myapp could have this:

```json
{
  ""bin"": {
    ""myapp"": ""
/cli
js""
  }
}
```

So, when you install myapp, in case of unix-like OS it'll create a symlink
from the `cli
js` script to `/usr/local/bin/myapp` and in case of windows it
will create a cmd file usually at `C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Roaming\npm\myapp
cmd`
which runs the `cli
js` script


If you have a single executable, and its name should be the name of the
package, then you can just supply it as a string
  For example:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""my-program"",
  ""version"": ""1
2
5"",
  ""bin"": ""
/path/to/program""
}
```

would be the same as this:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""my-program"",
  ""version"": ""1
2
5"",
  ""bin"": {
    ""my-program"": ""
/path/to/program""
  }
}
```

Please make sure that your file(s) referenced in `bin` starts with
`#!/usr/bin/env node`, otherwise the scripts are started without the node
executable!

Note that you can also set the executable files using [directories
bin](#directoriesbin)


See [folders](/configuring-npm/folders#executables) for more info on
executables


### man

Specify either a single file or an array of filenames to put in place for
the `man` program to find


If only a single file is provided, then it's installed such that it is the
result from `man <pkgname>`, regardless of its actual filename
  For
example:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""foo"",
  ""version"": ""1
2
3"",
  ""description"": ""A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos"",
  ""main"": ""foo
js"",
  ""man"": ""
/man/doc
1""
}
```

would link the `
/man/doc
1` file in such that it is the target for `man
foo`

If the filename doesn't start with the package name, then it's prefixed

So, this:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""foo"",
  ""version"": ""1
2
3"",
  ""description"": ""A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos"",
  ""main"": ""foo
js"",
  ""man"": [
    ""
/man/foo
1"",
    ""
/man/bar
1""
  ]
}
```

will create files to do `man foo` and `man foo-bar`


Man files must end with a number, and optionally a `
gz` suffix if they are
compressed
  The number dictates which man section the file is installed
into


```json
{
  ""name"": ""foo"",
  ""version"": ""1
2
3"",
  ""description"": ""A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos"",
  ""main"": ""foo
js"",
  ""man"": [
    ""
/man/foo
1"",
    ""
/man/foo
2""
  ]
}
```

will create entries for `man foo` and `man 2 foo`

### directories

The CommonJS [Packages](http://wiki
commonjs
org/wiki/Packages/1
0) spec
details a few ways that you can indicate the structure of your package
using a `directories` object
 If you look at [npm's
package
json](https://registry
npmjs
org/npm/latest), you'll see that it
has directories for doc, lib, and man


In the future, this information may be used in other creative ways


#### directories
bin

If you specify a `bin` directory in `directories
bin`, all the files in
that folder will be added


Because of the way the `bin` directive works, specifying both a `bin` path
and setting `directories
bin` is an error
 If you want to specify
individual files, use `bin`, and for all the files in an existing `bin`
directory, use `directories
bin`


#### directories
man

A folder that is full of man pages
  Sugar to generate a ""man"" array by
walking the folder


### repository

Specify the place where your code lives
 This is helpful for people who
want to contribute
  If the git repo is on GitHub, then the `npm docs`
command will be able to find you


Do it like this:

```json
{
  ""repository"": {
    ""type"": ""git"",
    ""url"": ""https://github
com/npm/cli
git""
  }
}
```

The URL should be a publicly available (perhaps read-only) URL that can be
handed directly to a VCS program without any modification
  It's for
computers


For GitHub, GitHub gist, Bitbucket, or GitLab repositories you can use the
same shortcut syntax you use for `npm install`:

```json
{
  ""repository"": ""npm/npm"",

  ""repository"": ""github:user/repo"",

  ""repository"": ""gist:11081aaa281"",

  ""repository"": ""bitbucket:user/repo"",

  ""repository"": ""gitlab:user/repo""
}
```

If the `package
json` for your package is not in the root directory (for
example if it is part of a monorepo), you can specify the directory in
which it lives:

```json
{
  ""repository"": {
    ""type"": ""git"",
    ""url"": ""https://github
com/facebook/react
git"",
    ""directory"": ""packages/react-dom""
  }
}
```

### scripts

The ""scripts"" property is a dictionary containing script commands that are
run at various times in the lifecycle of your package
  The key is the
lifecycle event, and the value is the command to run at that point


See [`scripts`](/using-npm/scripts) to find out more about writing package
scripts


### config

A ""config"" object can be used to set configuration parameters used in
package scripts that persist across upgrades
  For instance, if a package
had the following:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""foo"",
  ""config"": {
    ""port"": ""8080""
  }
}
```

It could also have a ""start"" command that referenced the
`npm_package_config_port` environment variable


### dependencies

Dependencies are specified in a simple object that maps a package name to a
version range
 The version range is a string which has one or more
space-separated descriptors
  Dependencies can also be identified with a
tarball or git URL


**Please do not put test harnesses or transpilers or other ""development""
time tools in your `dependencies` object
**  See `devDependencies`, below


See [semver](https://github
com/npm/node-semver#versions) for more details about specifying version ranges


* `version` Must match `version` exactly
* `>version` Must be greater than `version`
* `>=version` etc
* `<version`
* `<=version`
* `~version` ""Approximately equivalent to version""  See
  [semver](https://github
com/npm/node-semver#versions)
* `^version` ""Compatible with version""  See [semver](https://github
com/npm/node-semver#versions)
* `1
2
x` 1
2
0, 1
2
1, etc
, but not 1
3
0
* `http://


` See 'URLs as Dependencies' below
* `*` Matches any version
* `""""` (just an empty string) Same as `*`
* `version1 - version2` Same as `>=version1 <=version2`

* `range1 || range2` Passes if either range1 or range2 are satisfied

* `git


` See 'Git URLs as Dependencies' below
* `user/repo` See 'GitHub URLs' below
* `tag` A specific version tagged and published as `tag`  See [`npm
  dist-tag`](/commands/npm-dist-tag)
* `path/path/path` See [Local Paths](#local-paths) below

For example, these are all valid:

```json
{
  ""dependencies"": {
    ""foo"": ""1
0
0 - 2
9999
9999"",
    ""bar"": "">=1
0
2 <2
1
2"",
    ""baz"": "">1
0
2 <=2
3
4"",
    ""boo"": ""2
0
1"",
    ""qux"": ""<1
0
0 || >=2
3
1 <2
4
5 || >=2
5
2 <3
0
0"",
    ""asd"": ""http://asdf
com/asdf
tar
gz"",
    ""til"": ""~1
2"",
    ""elf"": ""~1
2
3"",
    ""two"": ""2
x"",
    ""thr"": ""3
3
x"",
    ""lat"": ""latest"",
    ""dyl"": ""file:

/dyl""
  }
}
```

#### URLs as Dependencies

You may specify a tarball URL in place of a version range


This tarball will be downloaded and installed locally to your package at
install time


#### Git URLs as Dependencies

Git URLs are of the form:

```bash
<protocol>://[<user>[:<password>]@]<hostname>[:<port>][:][/]<path>[#<commit-ish> | #semver:<semver>]
```

`<protocol>` is one of `git`, `git+ssh`, `git+http`, `git+https`, or
`git+file`


If `#<commit-ish>` is provided, it will be used to clone exactly that
commit
 If the commit-ish has the format `#semver:<semver>`, `<semver>` can
be any valid semver range or exact version, and npm will look for any tags
or refs matching that range in the remote repository, much as it would for
a registry dependency
 If neither `#<commit-ish>` or `#semver:<semver>` is
specified, then the default branch is used


Examples:

```bash
git+ssh://git@github
com:npm/cli
git#v1
0
27
git+ssh://git@github
com:npm/cli#semver:^5
0
git+https://isaacs@github
com/npm/cli
git
git://github
com/npm/cli
git#v1
0
27
```

When installing from a `git` repository, the presence of certain fields in the
`package
json` will cause npm to believe it needs to perform a build
 To do so
your repository will be cloned into a temporary directory, all of its deps
installed, relevant scripts run, and the resulting directory packed and
installed


This flow will occur if your git dependency uses `workspaces`, or if any of the
following scripts are present:

* `build`
* `prepare`
* `prepack`
* `preinstall`
* `install`
* `postinstall`

If your git repository includes pre-built artifacts, you will likely want to
make sure that none of the above scripts are defined, or your dependency
will be rebuilt for every installation


#### GitHub URLs

As of version 1
1
65, you can refer to GitHub URLs as just ""foo"":
""user/foo-project""
  Just as with git URLs, a `commit-ish` suffix can be
included
  For example:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""foo"",
  ""version"": ""0
0
0"",
  ""dependencies"": {
    ""express"": ""expressjs/express"",
    ""mocha"": ""mochajs/mocha#4727d357ea"",
    ""module"": ""user/repo#feature\/branch""
  }
}
```

#### Local Paths

As of version 2
0
0 you can provide a path to a local directory that
contains a package
 Local paths can be saved using `npm install -S` or `npm
install --save`, using any of these forms:

```bash


/foo/bar
~/foo/bar

/foo/bar
/foo/bar
```

in which case they will be normalized to a relative path and added to your
`package
json`
 For example:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""baz"",
  ""dependencies"": {
    ""bar"": ""file:

/foo/bar""
  }
}
```

This feature is helpful for local offline development and creating tests
that require npm installing where you don't want to hit an external server,
but should not be used when publishing your package to the public registry


*note*: Packages linked by local path will not have their own
dependencies installed when `npm install` is ran in this case
  You must
run `npm install` from inside the local path itself


### devDependencies

If someone is planning on downloading and using your module in their
program, then they probably don't want or need to download and build the
external test or documentation framework that you use


In this case, it's best to map these additional items in a
`devDependencies` object


These things will be installed when doing `npm link` or `npm install` from
the root of a package, and can be managed like any other npm configuration
param
  See [`config`](/using-npm/config) for more on the topic


For build steps that are not platform-specific, such as compiling
CoffeeScript or other languages to JavaScript, use the `prepare` script to
do this, and make the required package a devDependency


For example:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""ethopia-waza"",
  ""description"": ""a delightfully fruity coffee varietal"",
  ""version"": ""1
2
3"",
  ""devDependencies"": {
    ""coffee-script"": ""~1
6
3""
  },
  ""scripts"": {
    ""prepare"": ""coffee -o lib/ -c src/waza
coffee""
  },
  ""main"": ""lib/waza
js""
}
```

The `prepare` script will be run before publishing, so that users can
consume the functionality without requiring them to compile it themselves

In dev mode (ie, locally running `npm install`), it'll run this script as
well, so that you can test it easily


### peerDependencies

In some cases, you want to express the compatibility of your package with a
host tool or library, while not necessarily doing a `require` of this host

This is usually referred to as a *plugin*
 Notably, your module may be
exposing a specific interface, expected and specified by the host
documentation


For example:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""tea-latte"",
  ""version"": ""1
3
5"",
  ""peerDependencies"": {
    ""tea"": ""2
x""
  }
}
```

This ensures your package `tea-latte` can be installed *along* with the
second major version of the host package `tea` only
 `npm install
tea-latte` could possibly yield the following dependency graph:

```bash
├── tea-latte@1
3
5
└── tea@2
2
0
```

In npm versions 3 through 6, `peerDependencies` were not automatically
installed, and would raise a warning if an invalid version of the peer
dependency was found in the tree
  As of npm v7, peerDependencies _are_
installed by default


Trying to install another plugin with a conflicting requirement may cause
an error if the tree cannot be resolved correctly
 For this reason, make
sure your plugin requirement is as broad as possible, and not to lock it
down to specific patch versions


Assuming the host complies with [semver](https://semver
org/), only changes
in the host package's major version will break your plugin
 Thus, if you've
worked with every 1
x version of the host package, use `""^1
0""` or `""1
x""`
to express this
 If you depend on features introduced in 1
5
2, use
`""^1
5
2""`


### peerDependenciesMeta

When a user installs your package, npm will emit warnings if packages
specified in `peerDependencies` are not already installed
 The
`peerDependenciesMeta` field serves to provide npm more information on how
your peer dependencies are to be used
 Specifically, it allows peer
dependencies to be marked as optional


For example:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""tea-latte"",
  ""version"": ""1
3
5"",
  ""peerDependencies"": {
    ""tea"": ""2
x"",
    ""soy-milk"": ""1
2""
  },
  ""peerDependenciesMeta"": {
    ""soy-milk"": {
      ""optional"": true
    }
  }
}
```

Marking a peer dependency as optional ensures npm will not emit a warning
if the `soy-milk` package is not installed on the host
 This allows you to
integrate and interact with a variety of host packages without requiring
all of them to be installed


### bundleDependencies

This defines an array of package names that will be bundled when publishing
the package


In cases where you need to preserve npm packages locally or have them
available through a single file download, you can bundle the packages in a
tarball file by specifying the package names in the `bundleDependencies`
array and executing `npm pack`


For example:

If we define a package
json like this:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""awesome-web-framework"",
  ""version"": ""1
0
0"",
  ""bundleDependencies"": [
    ""renderized"",
    ""super-streams""
  ]
}
```

we can obtain `awesome-web-framework-1
0
0
tgz` file by running `npm pack`

This file contains the dependencies `renderized` and `super-streams` which
can be installed in a new project by executing `npm install
awesome-web-framework-1
0
0
tgz`
  Note that the package names do not
include any versions, as that information is specified in `dependencies`


If this is spelled `""bundledDependencies""`, then that is also honored


Alternatively, `""bundleDependencies""` can be defined as a boolean value
 A
value of `true` will bundle all dependencies, a value of `false` will bundle
none


### optionalDependencies

If a dependency can be used, but you would like npm to proceed if it cannot
be found or fails to install, then you may put it in the
`optionalDependencies` object
  This is a map of package name to version or
URL, just like the `dependencies` object
  The difference is that build
failures do not cause installation to fail
  Running `npm install
--omit=optional` will prevent these dependencies from being installed


It is still your program's responsibility to handle the lack of the
dependency
  For example, something like this:

```js
try {
  var foo = require('foo')
  var fooVersion = require('foo/package
json')
version
} catch (er) {
  foo = null
}
if ( notGoodFooVersion(fooVersion) ) {
  foo = null
}

// 

 then later in your program 



if (foo) {
  foo
doFooThings()
}
```

Entries in `optionalDependencies` will override entries of the same name in
`dependencies`, so it's usually best to only put in one place


### overrides

If you need to make specific changes to dependencies of your dependencies, for
example replacing the version of a dependency with a known security issue,
replacing an existing dependency with a fork, or making sure that the same
version of a package is used everywhere, then you may add an override


Overrides provide a way to replace a package in your dependency tree with
another version, or another package entirely
 These changes can be scoped as
specific or as vague as desired


To make sure the package `foo` is always installed as version `1
0
0` no matter
what version your dependencies rely on:

```json
{
  ""overrides"": {
    ""foo"": ""1
0
0""
  }
}
```

The above is a short hand notation, the full object form can be used to allow
overriding a package itself as well as a child of the package
 This will cause
`foo` to always be `1
0
0` while also making `bar` at any depth beyond `foo`
also `1
0
0`:

```json
{
  ""overrides"": {
    ""foo"": {
      ""
"": ""1
0
0"",
      ""bar"": ""1
0
0""
    }
  }
}
```

To only override `foo` to be `1
0
0` when it's a child (or grandchild, or great
grandchild, etc) of the package `bar`:

```json
{
  ""overrides"": {
    ""bar"": {
      ""foo"": ""1
0
0""
    }
  }
}
```

Keys can be nested to any arbitrary length
 To override `foo` only when it's a
child of `bar` and only when `bar` is a child of `baz`:

```json
{
  ""overrides"": {
    ""baz"": {
      ""bar"": {
        ""foo"": ""1
0
0""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The key of an override can also include a version, or range of versions

To override `foo` to `1
0
0`, but only when it's a child of `bar@2
0
0`:

```json
{
  ""overrides"": {
    ""bar@2
0
0"": {
      ""foo"": ""1
0
0""
    }
  }
}
```

You may not set an override for a package that you directly depend on unless
both the dependency and the override itself share the exact same spec
 To make
this limitation easier to deal with, overrides may also be defined as a
reference to a spec for a direct dependency by prefixing the name of the
package you wish the version to match with a `$`


```json
{
  ""dependencies"": {
    ""foo"": ""^1
0
0""
  },
  ""overrides"": {
    // BAD, will throw an EOVERRIDE error
    // ""foo"": ""^2
0
0""
    // GOOD, specs match so override is allowed
    // ""foo"": ""^1
0
0""
    // BEST, the override is defined as a reference to the dependency
    ""foo"": ""$foo"",
    // the referenced package does not need to match the overridden one
    ""bar"": ""$foo""
  }
}
```

### engines

You can specify the version of node that your stuff works on:

```json
{
  ""engines"": {
    ""node"": "">=0
10
3 <15""
  }
}
```

And, like with dependencies, if you don't specify the version (or if you
specify ""\*"" as the version), then any version of node will do


You can also use the ""engines"" field to specify which versions of npm are
capable of properly installing your program
  For example:

```json
{
  ""engines"": {
    ""npm"": ""~1
0
20""
  }
}
```

Unless the user has set the
[`engine-strict` config](/using-npm/config#engine-strict) flag, this field is
advisory only and will only produce warnings when your package is installed as a
dependency


### os

You can specify which operating systems your
module will run on:

```json
{
  ""os"": [
    ""darwin"",
    ""linux""
  ]
}
```

You can also block instead of allowing operating systems, just prepend the
blocked os with a '!':

```json
{
  ""os"": [
    ""!win32""
  ]
}
```

The host operating system is determined by `process
platform`

It is allowed to both block and allow an item, although there isn't any
good reason to do this


### cpu

If your code only runs on certain cpu architectures,
you can specify which ones


```json
{
  ""cpu"": [
    ""x64"",
    ""ia32""
  ]
}
```

Like the `os` option, you can also block architectures:

```json
{
  ""cpu"": [
    ""!arm"",
    ""!mips""
  ]
}
```

The host architecture is determined by `process
arch`

### private

If you set `""private"": true` in your package
json, then npm will refuse to
publish it


This is a way to prevent accidental publication of private repositories

If you would like to ensure that a given package is only ever published to
a specific registry (for example, an internal registry), then use the
`publishConfig` dictionary described below to override the `registry`
config param at publish-time


### publishConfig

This is a set of config values that will be used at publish-time
 It's
especially handy if you want to set the tag, registry or access, so that
you can ensure that a given package is not tagged with ""latest"", published
to the global public registry or that a scoped module is private by
default


See [`config`](/using-npm/config) to see the list of config options that
can be overridden


### workspaces

The optional `workspaces` field is an array of file patterns that describes
locations within the local file system that the install client should look
up to find each [workspace](/using-npm/workspaces) that needs to be
symlinked to the top level `node_modules` folder


It can describe either the direct paths of the folders to be used as
workspaces or it can define globs that will resolve to these same folders


In the following example, all folders located inside the folder
`
/packages` will be treated as workspaces as long as they have valid
`package
json` files inside them:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""workspace-example"",
  ""workspaces"": [
    ""
/packages/*""
  ]
}
```

See [`workspaces`](/using-npm/workspaces) for more examples


### DEFAULT VALUES

npm will default some values based on package contents


* `""scripts"": {""start"": ""node server
js""}`

  If there is a `server
js` file in the root of your package, then npm will
  default the `start` command to `node server
js`


* `""scripts"":{""install"": ""node-gyp rebuild""}`

  If there is a `binding
gyp` file in the root of your package and you have
  not defined an `install` or `preinstall` script, npm will default the
  `install` command to compile using node-gyp


* `""contributors"": [


]`

  If there is an `AUTHORS` file in the root of your package, npm will treat
  each line as a `Name <email> (url)` format, where email and url are
  optional
  Lines which start with a `#` or are blank, will be ignored

title: package-lock
json
section: 5
description: A manifestation of the manifest
---

### Description

`package-lock
json` is automatically generated for any operations where npm
modifies either the `node_modules` tree, or `package
json`
 It describes the
exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to
generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates


This file is intended to be committed into source repositories, and serves
various purposes:

* Describe a single representation of a dependency tree such that
  teammates, deployments, and continuous integration are guaranteed to
  install exactly the same dependencies


* Provide a facility for users to ""time-travel"" to previous states of
  `node_modules` without having to commit the directory itself


* Facilitate greater visibility of tree changes through readable source
  control diffs


* Optimize the installation process by allowing npm to skip repeated
  metadata resolutions for previously-installed packages


* As of npm v7, lockfiles include enough information to gain a complete
  picture of the package tree, reducing the need to read `package
json`
  files, and allowing for significant performance improvements


### `package-lock
json` vs `npm-shrinkwrap
json`

Both of these files have the same format, and perform similar functions in
the root of a project


The difference is that `package-lock
json` cannot be published, and it will
be ignored if found in any place other than the root project


In contrast, [npm-shrinkwrap
json](/configuring-npm/npm-shrinkwrap-json) allows
publication, and defines the dependency tree from the point encountered

This is not recommended unless deploying a CLI tool or otherwise using the
publication process for producing production packages


If both `package-lock
json` and `npm-shrinkwrap
json` are present in the
root of a project, `npm-shrinkwrap
json` will take precedence and
`package-lock
json` will be ignored
package-lock
json`
  This contains information about the
tree, and is used in lieu of reading the entire `node_modules` hierarchy
provided that the following conditions are met:

- All package folders it references exist in the `node_modules` hierarchy

- No package folders exist in the `node_modules` hierarchy that are not
  listed in the lockfile

- The modified time of the file is at least as recent as all of the package
  folders it references


That is, the hidden lockfile will only be relevant if it was created as
part of the most recent update to the package tree
  If another CLI mutates
the tree in any way, this will be detected, and the hidden lockfile will be
ignored


Note that it _is_ possible to manually change the _contents_ of a package
in such a way that the modified time of the package folder is unaffected
js`, then the
modified time on `node_modules/foo` will not reflect this change
  If you
are manually editing files in `node_modules`, it is generally best to
delete the file at `node_modules/
package-lock
json`


As the hidden lockfile is ignored by older npm versions, it does not
contain the backwards compatibility affordances present in ""normal""
lockfiles
  That is, it is `lockfileVersion: 3`, rather than
`lockfileVersion: 2`


### Handling Old Lockfiles

When npm detects a lockfile from npm v6 or before during the package
installation process, it is automatically updated to fetch missing
information from either the `node_modules` tree or (in the case of empty
`node_modules` trees or very old lockfile formats) the npm registry


### File Format

#### `name`

The name of the package this is a package-lock for
 This will match what's
in `package
json`


#### `version`

The version of the package this is a package-lock for
 This will match
what's in `package
json`


#### `lockfileVersion`

An integer version, starting at `1` with the version number of this
document whose semantics were used when generating this
`package-lock
json`


Note that the file format changed significantly in npm v7 to track
information that would have otherwise required looking in `node_modules` or
the npm registry
  Lockfiles generated by npm v7 will contain
`lockfileVersion: 2`


* No version provided: an ""ancient"" shrinkwrap file from a version of npm
  prior to npm v5

* `1`: The lockfile version used by npm v5 and v6

* `2`: The lockfile version used by npm v7 and v8
 Backwards compatible to v1
  lockfiles

* `3`: The lockfile version used by npm v9 and above
 Backwards compatible to npm v7


npm will always attempt to get whatever data it can out of a lockfile, even
if it is not a version that it was designed to support


#### `packages`

This is an object that maps package locations to an object containing the
information about that package


The root project is typically listed with a key of `""""`, and all other
packages are listed with their relative paths from the root project folder


Package descriptors have the following fields:

* version: The version found in `package
json`

* resolved: The place where the package was actually resolved from
  In
  the case of packages fetched from the registry, this will be a url to a
  tarball
  In the case of git dependencies, this will be the full git url
  with commit sha
  In the case of link dependencies, this will be the
  location of the link target
 `registry
npmjs
org` is a magic value meaning
  ""the currently configured registry""


* integrity: A `sha512` or `sha1` [Standard Subresource
  Integrity](https://w3c
github
io/webappsec/specs/subresourceintegrity/)
  string for the artifact that was unpacked in this location


* link: A flag to indicate that this is a symbolic link
  If this is
  present, no other fields are specified, since the link target will also
  be included in the lockfile


* dev, optional, devOptional: If the package is strictly part of the
  `devDependencies` tree, then `dev` will be true
  If it is strictly part
  of the `optionalDependencies` tree, then `optional` will be set
  If it
  is both a `dev` dependency _and_ an `optional` dependency of a non-dev
  dependency, then `devOptional` will be set
  (An `optional` dependency of
  a `dev` dependency will have both `dev` and `optional` set
)

* inBundle: A flag to indicate that the package is a bundled dependency


* hasInstallScript: A flag to indicate that the package has a `preinstall`,
  `install`, or `postinstall` script


* hasShrinkwrap: A flag to indicate that the package has an
  `npm-shrinkwrap
json` file


* bin, license, engines, dependencies, optionalDependencies: fields from
  `package
json`

#### dependencies

Legacy data for supporting versions of npm that use `lockfileVersion: 1`

This is a mapping of package names to dependency objects
  Because the
object structure is strictly hierarchical, symbolic link dependencies are
somewhat challenging to represent in some cases


npm v7 ignores this section entirely if a `packages` section is present,
but does keep it up to date in order to support switching between npm v6
and npm v7


Dependency objects have the following fields:

* version: a specifier that varies depending on the nature of the package,
  and is usable in fetching a new copy of it


    * bundled dependencies: Regardless of source, this is a version number
      that is purely for informational purposes

    * registry sources: This is a version number
 (eg, `1
2
3`)
    * git sources: This is a git specifier with resolved committish
 (eg,
      `git+https://example
com/foo/bar#115311855adb0789a0466714ed48a1499ffea97e`)
    * http tarball sources: This is the URL of the tarball
 (eg,
      `https://example
com/example-1
3
0
tgz`)
    * local tarball sources: This is the file URL of the tarball
 (eg
      `file:///opt/storage/example-1
3
0
tgz`)
    * local link sources: This is the file URL of the link
 (eg
      `file:libs/our-module`)

* integrity: A `sha512` or `sha1` [Standard Subresource
  Integrity](https://w3c
github
io/webappsec/specs/subresourceintegrity/)
  string for the artifact that was unpacked in this location
  For git
  dependencies, this is the commit sha


* resolved: For registry sources this is path of the tarball relative to
  the registry URL
  If the tarball URL isn't on the same server as the
  registry URL then this is a complete URL
 `registry
npmjs
org` is a magic
  value meaning ""the currently configured registry""


* bundled:  If true, this is the bundled dependency and will be installed
  by the parent module
  When installing, this module will be extracted
  from the parent module during the extract phase, not installed as a
  separate dependency


* dev: If true then this dependency is either a development dependency ONLY
  of the top level module or a transitive dependency of one
  This is false
  for dependencies that are both a development dependency of the top level
  and a transitive dependency of a non-development dependency of the top
  level


* optional: If true then this dependency is either an optional dependency
  ONLY of the top level module or a transitive dependency of one
  This is
  false for dependencies that are both an optional dependency of the top
  level and a transitive dependency of a non-optional dependency of the top
  level


* requires: This is a mapping of module name to version
  This is a list of
  everything this module requires, regardless of where it will be
  installed
  The version should match via normal matching rules a
  dependency either in our `dependencies` or in a level higher than us


* dependencies: The dependencies of this dependency, exactly as at the top
  level

title: config
section: 7
description: More than you probably want to know about npm configuration
---

### Description

This article details npm configuration in general
 To learn about the `config` command,
see [`npm config`](/commands/npm-config)


npm gets its configuration values from the following sources, sorted by priority:

#### Command Line Flags

Putting `--foo bar` on the command line sets the `foo` configuration
parameter to `""bar""`
  A `--` argument tells the cli parser to stop
reading flags
  Using `--flag` without specifying any value will set
the value to `true`


Example: `--flag1 --flag2` will set both configuration parameters
to `true`, while `--flag1 --flag2 bar` will set `flag1` to `true`,
and `flag2` to `bar`
  Finally, `--flag1 --flag2 -- bar` will set
both configuration parameters to `true`, and the `bar` is taken
as a command argument


#### Environment Variables

Any environment variables that start with `npm_config_` will be
interpreted as a configuration parameter
  For example, putting
`npm_config_foo=bar` in your environment will set the `foo`
configuration parameter to `bar`
  Any environment configurations that
are not given a value will be given the value of `true`
  Config
values are case-insensitive, so `NPM_CONFIG_FOO=bar` will work the
same
 However, please note that inside [`scripts`](/using-npm/scripts)
npm will set its own environment variables and Node will prefer
those lowercase versions over any uppercase ones that you might set
com/npm/npm/issues/14528)


Notice that you need to use underscores instead of dashes, so `--allow-same-version`
would become `npm_config_allow_same_version=true`


#### npmrc Files

The four relevant files are:

* per-project configuration file (`/path/to/my/project/
npmrc`)
* per-user configuration file (defaults to `$HOME/
npmrc`; configurable via CLI
  option `--userconfig` or environment variable `$NPM_CONFIG_USERCONFIG`)
* global configuration file (defaults to `$PREFIX/etc/npmrc`; configurable via
  CLI option `--globalconfig` or environment variable `$NPM_CONFIG_GLOBALCONFIG`)
* npm's built-in configuration file (`/path/to/npm/npmrc`)

See [npmrc](/configuring-npm/npmrc) for more details


#### Default Configs

Run `npm config ls -l` to see a set of configuration parameters that are
internal to npm, and are defaults if nothing else is specified


### Shorthands and Other CLI Niceties

The following shorthands are parsed on the command-line:

* `-a`: `--all`
* `--enjoy-by`: `--before`
* `-c`: `--call`
* `--desc`: `--description`
* `-f`: `--force`
* `-g`: `--global`
* `--iwr`: `--include-workspace-root`
* `-L`: `--location`
* `-d`: `--loglevel info`
* `-s`: `--loglevel silent`
* `--silent`: `--loglevel silent`
* `--ddd`: `--loglevel silly`
* `--dd`: `--loglevel verbose`
* `--verbose`: `--loglevel verbose`
* `-q`: `--loglevel warn`
* `--quiet`: `--loglevel warn`
* `-l`: `--long`
* `-m`: `--message`
* `--local`: `--no-global`
* `-n`: `--no-yes`
* `--no`: `--no-yes`
* `-p`: `--parseable`
* `--porcelain`: `--parseable`
* `-C`: `--prefix`
* `--readonly`: `--read-only`
* `--reg`: `--registry`
* `-S`: `--save`
* `-B`: `--save-bundle`
* `-D`: `--save-dev`
* `-E`: `--save-exact`
* `-O`: `--save-optional`
* `-P`: `--save-prod`
* `-?`: `--usage`
* `-h`: `--usage`
* `-H`: `--usage`
* `--help`: `--usage`
* `-v`: `--version`
* `-w`: `--workspace`
* `--ws`: `--workspaces`
* `-y`: `--yes`

If the specified configuration param resolves unambiguously to a known
configuration parameter, then it is expanded to that configuration
parameter
  For example:

```bash
npm ls --par
# same as:
npm ls --parseable
```

If multiple single-character shorthands are strung together, and the
resulting combination is unambiguously not some other configuration
param, then it is expanded to its various component pieces
  For
example:

```bash
npm ls -gpld
# same as:
npm ls --global --parseable --long --loglevel info
```

### Config Settings

#### `_auth`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

A basic-auth string to use when authenticating against the npm registry

This will ONLY be used to authenticate against the npm registry
 For other
registries you will need to scope it like ""//other-registry
tld/:_auth""

Warning: This should generally not be set via a command-line option
 It is
safer to use a registry-provided authentication bearer token stored in the
~/
npmrc file by running `npm login`




#### `access`

* Default: 'public' for new packages, existing packages it will not change the
  current level
* Type: null, ""restricted"", or ""public""

If you do not want your scoped package to be publicly viewable (and
installable) set `--access=restricted`


Unscoped packages can not be set to `restricted`


Note: This defaults to not changing the current access level for existing
packages
 Specifying a value of `restricted` or `public` during publish will
change the access for an existing package the same way that `npm access set
status` would




#### `all`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When running `npm outdated` and `npm ls`, setting `--all` will show all
outdated or installed packages, rather than only those directly depended
upon by the current project




#### `allow-same-version`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Prevents throwing an error when `npm version` is used to set the new version
to the same value as the current version




#### `audit`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

When ""true"" submit audit reports alongside the current npm command to the
default registry and all registries configured for scopes
 See the
documentation for [`npm audit`](/commands/npm-audit) for details on what is
submitted




#### `audit-level`

* Default: null
* Type: null, ""info"", ""low"", ""moderate"", ""high"", ""critical"", or ""none""

The minimum level of vulnerability for `npm audit` to exit with a non-zero
exit code




#### `auth-type`

* Default: ""web""
* Type: ""legacy"" or ""web""

What authentication strategy to use with `login`
 Note that if an `otp`
config is given, this value will always be set to `legacy`




#### `before`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Date

If passed to `npm install`, will rebuild the npm tree such that only
versions that were available **on or before** the `--before` time get
installed
 If there's no versions available for the current set of direct
dependencies, the command will error


If the requested version is a `dist-tag` and the given tag does not pass the
`--before` filter, the most recent version less than or equal to that tag
will be used
 For example, `foo@latest` might install `foo@1
2` even though
`latest` is `2
0`




#### `bin-links`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Tells npm to create symlinks (or `
cmd` shims on Windows) for package
executables


Set to false to have it not do this




#### `browser`

* Default: OS X: `""open""`, Windows: `""start""`, Others: `""xdg-open""`
* Type: null, Boolean, or String

The browser that is called by npm commands to open websites


Set to `false` to suppress browser behavior and instead print urls to
terminal


Set to `true` to use default system URL opener




#### `ca`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String (can be set multiple times)

The Certificate Authority signing certificate that is trusted for SSL
connections to the registry
 Values should be in PEM format (Windows calls
it ""Base-64 encoded X
509 (
CER)"") with newlines replaced by the string
""\n""
 For example:

```ini
ca=""-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nXXXX\nXXXX\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----""
```

Set to `null` to only allow ""known"" registrars, or to a specific CA cert to
trust only that specific signing authority


Multiple CAs can be trusted by specifying an array of certificates:

```ini
ca[]=""


""
ca[]=""


""
```

See also the `strict-ssl` config




#### `cache`

* Default: Windows: `%LocalAppData%\npm-cache`, Posix: `~/
npm`
* Type: Path

The location of npm's cache directory




#### `cafile`

* Default: null
* Type: Path

A path to a file containing one or multiple Certificate Authority signing
certificates
 Similar to the `ca` setting, but allows for multiple CA's, as
well as for the CA information to be stored in a file on disk




#### `call`

* Default: """"
* Type: String

Optional companion option for `npm exec`, `npx` that allows for specifying a
custom command to be run along with the installed packages


```bash
npm exec --package yo --package generator-node --call ""yo node""
```



#### `cidr`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String (can be set multiple times)

This is a list of CIDR address to be used when configuring limited access
tokens with the `npm token create` command




#### `color`

* Default: true unless the NO_COLOR environ is set to something other than '0'
* Type: ""always"" or Boolean

If false, never shows colors
 If
true, then only prints color codes for tty file descriptors

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Run git commit hooks when using the `npm version` command




#### `cpu`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

Override CPU architecture of native modules to install
 Acceptable values
are same as `cpu` field of package
json, which comes from `process
arch`




#### `depth`

* Default: `Infinity` if `--all` is set, otherwise `1`
* Type: null or Number

The depth to go when recursing packages for `npm ls`


If not set, `npm ls` will show only the immediate dependencies of the root
project
 If `--all` is set, then npm will show all dependencies by default




#### `description`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Show the description in `npm search`



#### `diff`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Define arguments to compare in `npm diff`




#### `diff-dst-prefix`

* Default: ""b/""
* Type: String

Destination prefix to be used in `npm diff` output




#### `diff-ignore-all-space`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Ignore whitespace when comparing lines in `npm diff`




#### `diff-name-only`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Prints only filenames when using `npm diff`




#### `diff-no-prefix`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Do not show any source or destination prefix in `npm diff` output


Note: this causes `npm diff` to ignore the `--diff-src-prefix` and
`--diff-dst-prefix` configs




#### `diff-src-prefix`

* Default: ""a/""
* Type: String

Source prefix to be used in `npm diff` output




#### `diff-text`

* Type: Number

The number of lines of context to print in `npm diff`




#### `dry-run`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done
 This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, `install`, `update`,
`dedupe`, `uninstall`, as well as `pack` and `publish`


Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg `dist-tags`,
`owner`, etc




#### `editor`

* Default: The EDITOR or VISUAL environment variables, or
  '%SYSTEMROOT%\notepad
exe' on Windows, or 'vi' on Unix systems
* Type: String

The command to run for `npm edit` and `npm config edit`




#### `engine-strict`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to true, then npm will stubbornly refuse to install (or even consider
installing) any package that claims to not be compatible with the current
Node
js version


This can be overridden by setting the `--force` flag




#### `expect-result-count`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Number

Tells to expect a specific number of results from the command


This config can not be used with: `expect-results`

#### `expect-results`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Tells npm whether or not to expect results from the command
 Can be either
true (expect some results) or false (expect no results)


This config can not be used with: `expect-result-count`

#### `fetch-retries`

* Default: 2
* Type: Number

mistakes, unnecessary performance degradation, and malicious input


* Allow clobbering non-npm files in global installs

* Allow the `npm version` command to work on an unclean git repository

* Allow deleting the cache folder with `npm cache clean`

* Allow installing packages that have an `engines` declaration requiring a
  different version of npm

* Allow installing packages that have an `engines` declaration requiring a
  different version of `node`, even if `--engine-strict` is enabled

* Allow `npm audit fix` to install modules outside your stated dependency
  range (including SemVer-major changes)

* Allow unpublishing all versions of a published package

* Allow conflicting peerDependencies to be installed in the root project

* Implicitly set `--yes` during `npm init`

* Allow clobbering existing values in `npm pkg`
* Allow unpublishing of entire packages (not just a single version)


If you don't have a clear idea of what you want to do, it is strongly
recommended that you do not use this option!



#### `foreground-scripts`

* Default: `false` unless when using `npm pack` or `npm publish` where it
  defaults to `true`
* Type: Boolean

Run all build scripts (ie, `preinstall`, `install`, and `postinstall`)
scripts for installed packages in the foreground process, sharing standard
input, output, and error with the main npm process


Note that this will generally make installs run slower, and be much noisier,
but can be useful for debugging




#### `format-package-lock`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Format `package-lock
json` or `npm-shrinkwrap
json` as a human readable
file




#### `fund`

* Default: true

When ""true"" displays the message at the end of each `npm install`
acknowledging the number of dependencies looking for funding
 See [`npm
fund`](/commands/npm-fund) for details




#### `git`

* Default: ""git""
* Type: String

The command to use for git commands
 If git is installed on the computer,
but is not in the `PATH`, then set this to the full path to the git binary




#### `git-tag-version`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Tag the commit when using the `npm version` command
 Setting this to false
results in no commit being made at all




#### `global`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Operates in ""global"" mode, so that packages are installed into the `prefix`
folder instead of the current working directory
 See
[folders](/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior


* packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead
  of the current working directory

* bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
* man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`



#### `globalconfig`

* Default: The global --prefix setting plus 'etc/npmrc'
 For example,
  '/usr/local/etc/npmrc'
* Type: Path

The config file to read for global config options




#### `heading`

* Default: ""npm""
* Type: String

The string that starts all the debugging log output




#### `https-proxy`

* Default: null
* Type: null or URL

A proxy to use for outgoing https requests
 If the `HTTPS_PROXY` or
`https_proxy` or `HTTP_PROXY` or `http_proxy` environment variables are set,
proxy settings will be honored by the underlying `make-fetch-happen`
library




#### `if-present`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm will not exit with an error code when `run-script` is invoked
for a script that isn't defined in the `scripts` section of `package
json`

This option can be used when it's desirable to optionally run a script when
it's present and fail if the script fails
 This is useful, for example, when
running scripts that may only apply for some builds in an otherwise generic
CI setup


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package
json files


Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run-script`
will still run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they
will *not* run any pre- or post-scripts




#### `include`

* Default:
* Type: ""prod"", ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Option that allows for defining which types of dependencies to install


This is the inverse of `--omit=<type>`


Dependency types specified in `--include` will not be omitted, regardless of
the order in which omit/include are specified on the command-line




#### `include-staged`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Allow installing ""staged"" published packages, as defined by [npm RFC PR
#92](https://github
com/npm/rfcs/pull/92)


This is experimental, and not implemented by the npm public registry




#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command


When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `init-author-email`

* Default: """"
* Type: String

The value `npm init` should use by default for the package author's email




#### `init-author-name`

* Default: """"
* Type: String

The value `npm init` should use by default for the package author's name




#### `init-author-url`

* Default: """"
* Type: """" or URL

The value `npm init` should use by default for the package license




#### `init-module`

* Default: ""~/
npm-init
js""
* Type: Path

A module that will be loaded by the `npm init` command
 See the
documentation for the
[init-package-json](https://github
com/npm/init-package-json) module for
more information, or [npm init](/commands/npm-init)




#### `init-version`

* Default: ""1
0
0""
* Type: SemVer string

The value that `npm init` should use by default for the package version
number, if not already set in package
json




#### `install-links`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When set file: protocol dependencies will be packed and installed as regular
dependencies instead of creating a symlink
 This option has no effect on
workspaces




#### `install-strategy`

* Default: ""hoisted""
* Type: ""hoisted"", ""nested"", ""shallow"", or ""linked""

Sets the strategy for installing packages in node_modules
 hoisted
(default): Install non-duplicated in top-level, and duplicated as necessary
within directory structure
 nested: (formerly --legacy-bundling) install in
place, no hoisting
 shallow (formerly --global-style) only install direct
deps at top-level
 linked: (experimental) install in node_modules/
store,
link in place, unhoisted




#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output


* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON
parse() before
  saving them to your `package
json`


Not supported by all npm commands




#### `legacy-peer-deps`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Causes npm to completely ignore `peerDependencies` when building a package
tree, as in npm versions 3 through 6


If a package cannot be installed because of overly strict `peerDependencies`
that collide, it provides a way to move forward resolving the situation


This differs from `--omit=peer`, in that `--omit=peer` will avoid unpacking
`peerDependencies` on disk, but will still design a tree such that
`peerDependencies` _could_ be unpacked in a correct place


Use of `legacy-peer-deps` is not recommended, as it will not enforce the
`peerDependencies` contract that meta-dependencies may rely on




#### `libc`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

Override libc of native modules to install
 Acceptable values are same as
`libc` field of package
json



#### `link`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Used with `npm ls`, limiting output to only those packages that are linked




#### `local-address`

* Default: null
* Type: IP Address

The IP address of the local interface to use when making connections to the
npm registry
 Must be IPv4 in versions of Node prior to 0
12




#### `location`

* Default: ""user"" unless `--global` is passed, which will also set this value
  to ""global""
* Type: ""global"", ""user"", or ""project""

When passed to `npm config` this refers to which config file to use


When set to ""global"" mode, packages are installed into the `prefix` folder
instead of the current working directory
 See
[folders](/configuring-npm/folders) for more on the differences in behavior


* packages are installed into the `{prefix}/lib/node_modules` folder, instead
  of the current working directory

* bin files are linked to `{prefix}/bin`
* man pages are linked to `{prefix}/share/man`



#### `lockfile-version`

* Default: Version 3 if no lockfile, auto-converting v1 lockfiles to v3,
  otherwise maintain current lockfile version

* Type: null, 1, 2, 3, ""1"", ""2"", or ""3""

Set the lockfile format version to be used in package-lock
json and
npm-shrinkwrap-json files
 Possible options are:

1: The lockfile version used by npm versions 5 and 6
 Lacks some data that
is used during the install, resulting in slower and possibly less
deterministic installs
 Prevents lockfile churn when interoperating with
older npm versions


2: The default lockfile version used by npm version 7 and 8
 Includes both
the version 1 lockfile data and version 3 lockfile data, for maximum
determinism and interoperability, at the expense of more bytes on disk


3: Only the new lockfile information introduced in npm version 7
 Smaller on
disk than lockfile version 2, but not interoperable with older npm versions

Ideal if all users are on npm version 7 and higher




#### `loglevel`

* Default: ""notice""
* Type: ""silent"", ""error"", ""warn"", ""notice"", ""http"", ""info"", ""verbose"", or
  ""silly""

What level of logs to report


Any logs of a higher level than the setting are shown
 The default is
""notice""


See also the `foreground-scripts` config
 See [`npm logging`](/using-npm/logging)
for more information




#### `logs-max`

#### `maxsockets`

* Default: 15
* Type: Number

The maximum number of connections to use per origin (protocol/host/port
combination)




#### `message`

* Default: ""%s""
* Type: String

Commit message which is used by `npm version` when creating version commit


Any ""%s"" in the message will be replaced with the version number




#### `node-options`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

Options to pass through to Node
js via the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment
variable
 This does not impact how npm itself is executed but it does impact
how lifecycle scripts are called




#### `noproxy`

* Default: The value of the NO_PROXY environment variable
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Domain extensions that should bypass any proxies


Also accepts a comma-delimited string




#### `offline`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Force offline mode: no network requests will be done during install
 To
allow the CLI to fill in missing cache data, see `--prefer-offline`




#### `omit`

* Default: 'dev' if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to
  'production', otherwise empty

* Type: ""dev"", ""optional"", or ""peer"" (can be set multiple times)

Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk


Note that these dependencies _are_ still resolved and added to the
`package-lock
json` or `npm-shrinkwrap
json` file
 They are just not
physically installed on disk


If a package type appears in both the `--include` and `--omit` lists, then
it will be included


If the resulting omit list includes `'dev'`, then the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable will be set to `'production'` for all lifecycle scripts




#### `omit-lockfile-registry-resolved`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

This option causes npm to create lock files without a `resolved` key for
registry dependencies
 Subsequent installs will need to resolve tarball
endpoints with the configured registry, likely resulting in a longer install
time




#### `os`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

Override OS of native modules to install
 Acceptable values are same as `os`
field of package
json, which comes from `process
platform`




#### `otp`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator
 It's needed
when publishing or changing package permissions with `npm access`


If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time
password, npm will prompt on the command line for one




#### `pack-destination`

* Default: ""
""
* Type: String

Directory in which `npm pack` will save tarballs




#### `package`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

The package or packages to install for [`npm exec`](/commands/npm-exec)



#### `package-lock`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

If set to false, then ignore `package-lock
json` files when installing
 This
will also prevent _writing_ `package-lock
json` if `save` is true




#### `package-lock-only`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to true, the current operation will only use the `package-lock
json`,
ignoring `node_modules`


For `update` this means only the `package-lock
json` will be updated,
instead of checking `node_modules` and downloading dependencies


For `list` this means the output will be based on the tree described by the
`package-lock
json`, rather than the contents of `node_modules`




#### `parseable`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Output parseable results from commands that write to standard output
 For
`npm search`, this will be tab-separated table format




#### `prefer-dedupe`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Prefer to deduplicate packages if possible, rather than choosing a newer
version of a dependency




#### `prefer-offline`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, staleness checks for cached data will be bypassed, but missing data
will be requested from the server
 To force full offline mode, use
`--offline`




#### `prefer-online`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, staleness checks for cached data will be forced, making the CLI
look for updates immediately even for fresh package data




#### `prefix`

* Default: In global mode, the folder where the node executable is installed

  Otherwise, the nearest parent folder containing either a package
json file
  or a node_modules folder

* Type: Path

The location to install global items
 If set on the command line, then it
forces non-global commands to run in the specified folder




#### `preid`

* Default: """"
* Type: String

The ""prerelease identifier"" to use as a prefix for the ""prerelease"" part of
a semver
 Like the `rc` in `1
2
0-rc
8`




#### `progress`

* Default: `true` unless running in a known CI system
* Type: Boolean

When set to `true`, npm will display a progress bar during time intensive
operations, if `process
stderr` is a TTY


Set to `false` to suppress the progress bar




#### `provenance`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When publishing from a supported cloud CI/CD system, the package will be
publicly linked to where it was built and published from


This config can not be used with: `provenance-file`

#### `provenance-file`

When publishing, the provenance bundle at the given path will be used


This config can not be used with: `provenance`

#### `proxy`

* Default: null
* Type: null, false, or URL

A proxy to use for outgoing http requests
 If the `HTTP_PROXY` or
`http_proxy` environment variables are set, proxy settings will be honored
by the underlying `request` library




#### `read-only`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

This is used to mark a token as unable to publish when configuring limited
access tokens with the `npm token create` command




#### `rebuild-bundle`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Rebuild bundled dependencies after installation




#### `registry`

* Default: ""https://registry
npmjs
org/""
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry




#### `replace-registry-host`

* Default: ""npmjs""
* Type: ""npmjs"", ""never"", ""always"", or String

Defines behavior for replacing the registry host in a lockfile with the
configured registry


The default behavior is to replace package dist URLs from the default
registry (https://registry
npmjs
org) to the configured registry
 If set to
""never"", then use the registry value
 If set to ""always"", then replace the
registry host with the configured host every time


You may also specify a bare hostname (e
g
, ""registry
npmjs
org"")




#### `save`

* Default: `true` unless when using `npm update` where it defaults to `false`
* Type: Boolean

Save installed packages to a `package
json` file as dependencies


When used with the `npm rm` command, removes the dependency from
`package
json`


Will also prevent writing to `package-lock
json` if set to `false`




#### `save-bundle`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If a package would be saved at install time by the use of `--save`,
`--save-dev`, or `--save-optional`, then also put it in the
`bundleDependencies` list


Ignored if `--save-peer` is set, since peerDependencies cannot be bundled




#### `save-dev`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Save installed packages to a package
json file as `devDependencies`




#### `save-exact`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Dependencies saved to package
json will be configured with an exact version
rather than using npm's default semver range operator




#### `save-optional`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Save installed packages to a package
json file as `optionalDependencies`




#### `save-peer`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Save installed packages to a package
json file as `peerDependencies`



#### `save-prefix`

* Default: ""^""
* Type: String

Configure how versions of packages installed to a package
json file via
`--save` or `--save-dev` get prefixed


For example if a package has version `1
2
3`, by default its version is set
to `^1
2
3` which allows minor upgrades for that package, but after `npm
config set save-prefix='~'` it would be set to `~1
2
3` which only allows
patch upgrades




#### `save-prod`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Save installed packages into `dependencies` specifically
 This is useful if
a package already exists in `devDependencies` or `optionalDependencies`, but
you want to move it to be a non-optional production dependency


This is the default behavior if `--save` is true, and neither `--save-dev`
or `--save-optional` are true




#### `sbom-format`

* Default: null
* Type: ""cyclonedx"" or ""spdx""

SBOM format to use when generating SBOMs




#### `sbom-type`

* Default: ""library""
* Type: ""library"", ""application"", or ""framework""

The type of package described by the generated SBOM
 For SPDX, this is the
value for the `primaryPackagePurpose` field
 For CycloneDX, this is the
value for the `type` field




#### `scope`

* Default: the scope of the current project, if any, or """"
* Type: String

Associate an operation with a scope for a scoped registry


Useful when logging in to or out of a private registry:

```
# log in, linking the scope to the custom registry
npm login --scope=@mycorp --registry=https://registry
mycorp
com

# log out, removing the link and the auth token
npm logout --scope=@mycorp
```

This will cause `@mycorp` to be mapped to the registry for future
installation of packages specified according to the pattern
`@mycorp/package`


This will also cause `npm init` to create a scoped package


```
# accept all defaults, and create a package named ""@foo/whatever"",
# instead of just named ""whatever""
npm init --scope=@foo --yes
```



#### `script-shell`

* Default: '/bin/sh' on POSIX systems, 'cmd
exe' on Windows

exe"" on
  Windows
* Type: String

The shell to run for the `npm explore` command




#### `sign-git-commit`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to true, then the `npm version` command will commit the new package
version using `-S` to add a signature


Note that git requires you to have set up GPG keys in your git configs for
this to work properly




#### `sign-git-tag`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to true, then the `npm version` command will tag the version using
`-s` to add a signature


Note that git requires you to have set up GPG keys in your git configs for
this to work properly




#### `strict-peer-deps`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to `true`, and `--legacy-peer-deps` is not set, then _any_
conflicting `peerDependencies` will be treated as an install failure, even
if npm could reasonably guess the appropriate resolution based on non-peer
dependency relationships


By default, conflicting `peerDependencies` deep in the dependency graph will
be resolved using the nearest non-peer dependency specification, even if
doing so will result in some packages receiving a peer dependency outside
the range set in their package's `peerDependencies` object


When such an override is performed, a warning is printed, explaining the
conflict and the packages involved
 If `--strict-peer-deps` is set, then
this warning is treated as a failure




#### `strict-ssl`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to do SSL key validation when making requests to the registry
via https


See also the `ca` config




#### `tag`

* Default: ""latest""
* Type: String

If you ask npm to install a package and don't tell it a specific version,
then it will install the specified tag


Also the tag that is added to the package@version specified by the `npm tag`
command, if no explicit tag is given


When used by the `npm diff` command, this is the tag used to fetch the
tarball that will be compared with the local files by default




#### `tag-version-prefix`

* Default: ""v""
* Type: String

If set, alters the prefix used when tagging a new version when performing a
version increment using `npm version`
 To remove the prefix altogether, set
it to the empty string: `""""`
0
0`, _only use this property if it is absolutely necessary_
 In
particular, use care when overriding this setting for public packages




#### `timing`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, writes timing information to a process specific json file in the
cache or `logs-dir`
 The file name ends with `-timing
json`


You can quickly view it with this [json](https://npm
im/json) command line:
`cat ~/
json | npm exec -- json -g`


Timing information will also be reported in the terminal
 To suppress this
while still writing the timing file, use `--silent`




#### `umask`

* Default: 0
* Type: Octal numeric string in range 0000

0777 (0

511)

The ""umask"" value to use when setting the file creation mode on files and
folders


Folders and executables are given a mode which is `0o777` masked against
this value
 Other files are given a mode which is `0o666` masked against
this value


Note that the underlying system will _also_ apply its own umask value to
files and folders that are created, and npm does not circumvent this, but
rather adds the `--umask` config to it


Thus, the effective default umask value on most POSIX systems is 0o22,
meaning that folders and executables are created with a mode of 0o755 and
other files are created with a mode of 0o644




#### `update-notifier`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Set to false to suppress the update notification when using an older version
of npm than the latest




#### `usage`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Show short usage output about the command specified




#### `user-agent`

* Default: ""npm/{npm-version} node/{node-version} {platform} {arch}
  workspaces/{workspaces} {ci}""
* Type: String

Sets the User-Agent request header
 The following fields are replaced with
their actual counterparts:

* `{npm-version}` - The npm version in use
* `{node-version}` - The Node
js version in use
* `{platform}` - The value of `process
platform`
* `{arch}` - The value of `process
arch`
* `{workspaces}` - Set to `true` if the `workspaces` or `workspace` options
  are set

* `{ci}` - The value of the `ci-name` config, if set, prefixed with `ci/`, or
  an empty string if `ci-name` is empty




#### `userconfig`

* Default: ""~/
npmrc""
* Type: Path

The location of user-level configuration settings


This may be overridden by the `npm_config_userconfig` environment variable
or the `--userconfig` command line option, but may _not_ be overridden by
settings in the `globalconfig` file




#### `version`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, output the npm version and exit successfully


Only relevant when specified explicitly on the command line




#### `versions`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, output the npm version as well as node's `process
versions` map and
the version in the current working directory's `package
json` file if one
exists, and exit successfully


Only relevant when specified explicitly on the command line




#### `viewer`

* Default: ""man"" on Posix, ""browser"" on Windows
* Type: String

The program to use to view help content


Set to `""browser""` to view html help content in the default web browser




#### `which`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Number

If there are multiple funding sources, which 1-indexed source URL to open




#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option


Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces


Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether
 When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc
)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder
 - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc
) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config


This value is not exported to the environment for child processes


#### `workspaces-update`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

If set to true, the npm cli will run an update after operations that may
possibly change the workspaces installed to the `node_modules` folder




#### `yes`

* Default: null

Automatically answer ""yes"" to any prompts that npm might print on the
command line




#### `also`

* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of `--prefer-online`

`--cache-max=0` is an alias for `--prefer-online`



#### `cache-min`

* Default: 0
* Type: Number
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of `--prefer-offline`


`--cache-min=9999 (or bigger)` is an alias for `--prefer-offline`




#### `cert`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String
* DEPRECATED: `key` and `cert` are no longer used for most registry
  operations
 Use registry scoped `keyfile` and `certfile` instead
 Example:
  //other-registry
tld/:keyfile=/path/to/key
pem
  //other-registry
tld/:certfile=/path/to/cert
crt

A client certificate to pass when accessing the registry
 Values should be
in PEM format (Windows calls it ""Base-64 encoded X
509 (
CER)"") with
newlines replaced by the string ""\n""
 For example:

```ini
cert=""-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nXXXX\nXXXX\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----""
```

It is _not_ the path to a certificate file, though you can set a
registry-scoped ""certfile"" path like
""//other-registry
tld/:certfile=/path/to/cert
pem""




#### `dev`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: Please use --include=dev instead


Alias for `--include=dev`




#### `global-style`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=shallow`

Only install direct dependencies in the top level `node_modules`, but hoist
on deeper dependencies
 Sets `--install-strategy=shallow`




#### `init
author
email`

Alias for `--init-version`



#### `key`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

  operations
 Use registry scoped `keyfile` and `certfile` instead
 Example:
  //other-registry
tld/:keyfile=/path/to/key
pem
  //other-registry
tld/:certfile=/path/to/cert
crt

A client key to pass when accessing the registry
 Values should be in PEM
format with newlines replaced by the string ""\n""
 For example:

```ini
key=""-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nXXXX\nXXXX\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----""
```

It is _not_ the path to a key file, though you can set a registry-scoped
""keyfile"" path like ""//other-registry
tld/:keyfile=/path/to/key
pem""




#### `legacy-bundling`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean
* DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of
  `--install-strategy=nested`

Instead of hoisting package installs in `node_modules`, install packages in
the same manner that they are depended on

title: Dependency Selector Syntax & Querying
section: 7
description: Dependency Selector Syntax & Querying
---

### Description

The [`npm query`](/commands/npm-query) command exposes a new dependency selector syntax (informed by & respecting many aspects of the [CSS Selectors 4 Spec](https://dev
w3
org/csswg/selectors4/#relational)) which:

- Standardizes the shape of, & querying of, dependency graphs with a robust object model, metadata & selector syntax
- Leverages existing, known language syntax & operators from CSS to make disparate package information broadly accessible
- Unlocks the ability to answer complex, multi-faceted questions about dependencies, their relationships & associative metadata
- Consolidates redundant logic of similar query commands in `npm` (ex
 `npm fund`, `npm ls`, `npm outdated`, `npm audit` 


)

### Dependency Selector Syntax

#### Overview:

- there is no ""type"" or ""tag"" selectors (ex
 `div, h1, a`) as a dependency/target is the only type of `Node` that can be queried
- the term ""dependencies"" is in reference to any `Node` found in a `tree` returned by `Arborist`

#### Combinators

- `>` direct descendant/child
- ` ` any descendant/child
- `~` sibling

#### Selectors

- `*` universal selector
- `#<name>` dependency selector (equivalent to `[name=""


""]`)
- `#<name>@<version>` (equivalent to `[name=<name>]:semver(<version>)`)
- `,` selector list delimiter
- `
` dependency type selector
- `:` pseudo selector

#### Dependency Type Selectors

- `
prod` dependency found in the `dependencies` section of `package
json`, or is a child of said dependency
- `
dev` dependency found in the `devDependencies` section of `package
json`, or is a child of said dependency
- `
optional` dependency found in the `optionalDependencies` section of `package
json`, or has `""optional"": true` set in its entry in the `peerDependenciesMeta` section of `package
json`, or a child of said dependency
- `
peer` dependency found in the `peerDependencies` section of `package
json`
- `
workspace` dependency found in the [`workspaces`](https://docs
npmjs
com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces) section of `package
json`
- `
bundled` dependency found in the `bundleDependencies` section of `package
json`, or is a child of said dependency

#### Pseudo Selectors
- [`:not(<selector>)`](https://developer
mozilla
org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:not)
- [`:has(<selector>)`](https://developer
mozilla
org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has)
- [`:is(<selector list>)`](https://developer
mozilla
org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:is)
- [`:root`](https://developer
mozilla
org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) matches the root node/dependency
- [`:scope`](https://developer
mozilla
org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:scope) matches node/dependency it was queried against
- [`:empty`](https://developer
mozilla
org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:empty) when a dependency has no dependencies
- [`:private`](https://docs
npmjs
com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#private) when a dependency is private
- `:link` when a dependency is linked (for instance, workspaces or packages manually [`linked`](https://docs
npmjs
com/cli/v8/commands/npm-link)
- `:deduped` when a dependency has been deduped (note that this does *not* always mean the dependency has been hoisted to the root of node_modules)
- `:overridden` when a dependency has been overridden
- `:extraneous` when a dependency exists but is not defined as a dependency of any node
- `:invalid` when a dependency version is out of its ancestors specified range
- `:missing` when a dependency is not found on disk
- `:semver(<spec>, [selector], [function])` match a valid [`node-semver`](https://github
com/npm/node-semver) version or range to a selector
- `:path(<path>)` [glob](https://www
npmjs
com/package/glob) matching based on dependencies path relative to the project
- `:type(<type>)` [based on currently recognized types](https://github
com/npm/npm-package-arg#result-object)
- `:outdated(<type>)` when a dependency is outdated
- `:vuln(<selector>)` when a dependency has a known vulnerability

##### `:semver(<spec>, [selector], [function])`

The `:semver()` pseudo selector allows comparing fields from each node's `package
json` using [semver](https://github
com/npm/node-semver#readme) methods
 It accepts up to 3 parameters, all but the first of which are optional


- `spec` a semver version or range
- `selector` an attribute selector for each node (default `[version]`)
- `function` a semver method to apply, one of: `satisfies`, `intersects`, `subset`, `gt`, `gte`, `gtr`, `lt`, `lte`, `ltr`, `eq`, `neq` or the special function `infer` (default `infer`)

When the special `infer` function is used the `spec` and the actual value from the node are compared
 If both are versions, according to `semver
 If both values are ranges, according to `!semver
valid()`, `intersects` is used
 If the values are mixed types `satisfies` is used


Some examples:

- `:semver(^1
0
0)` returns every node that has a `version` satisfied by the provided range `^1
0
0`
- `:semver(16
0
0, :attr(engines, [node]))` returns every node which has an `engines
node` property satisfying the version `16
0
0`
- `:semver(1
0
0, [version], lt)` every node with a `version` less than `1
0
0`

##### `:outdated(<type>)`

The `:outdated` pseudo selector retrieves data from the registry and returns information about which of your dependencies are outdated
 The type parameter may be one of the following:

- `any` (default) a version exists that is greater than the current one
- `in-range` a version exists that is greater than the current one, and satisfies at least one if its parent's dependencies
- `out-of-range` a version exists that is greater than the current one, does not satisfy at least one of its parent's dependencies
- `major` a version exists that is a semver major greater than the current one
- `minor` a version exists that is a semver minor greater than the current one
- `patch` a version exists that is a semver patch greater than the current one

In addition to the filtering performed by the pseudo selector, some extra data is added to the resulting objects
 The following data can be found under the `queryContext` property of each node


- `versions` an array of every available version of the given node
- `outdated
inRange` an array of objects, each with a `from` and `versions`, where `from` is the on-disk location of the node that depends on the current node and `versions` is an array of all available versions that satisfies that dependency
 This is only populated if `:outdated(in-range)` is used

- `outdated
outOfRange` an array of objects, identical in shape to `inRange`, but where the `versions` array is every available version that does not satisfy the dependency
 This is only populated if `:outdated(out-of-range)` is used


Some examples:

- `:root > :outdated(major)` returns every direct dependency that has a new semver major release
- `
prod:outdated(in-range)` returns production dependencies that have a new release that satisfies at least one of its parent's dependencies

##### `:vuln`

The `:vuln` pseudo selector retrieves data from the registry and returns information about which if your dependencies has a known vulnerability
  Only dependencies whose current version matches a vulnerability will be returned
  For example if you have `semver@7
6
0` in your tree, a vulnerability for `semver` which affects versions `<=6
3
1` will not match


You can also filter results by certain attributes in advisories
  Currently that includes `severity` and `cwe`
  Note that severity filtering is done per severity, it does not include severities ""higher"" or ""lower"" than the one specified


In addition to the filtering performed by the pseudo selector, info about each relevant advisory will be added to the `queryContext` attribute of each node under the `advisories` attribute


Some examples:

- `:root > 
prod:vuln` returns direct production dependencies with any known vulnerability
- `:vuln([severity=high])` returns only dependencies with a vulnerability with a `high` severity

- `:vuln([severity=high],[severity=moderate])` returns only dependencies with a vulnerability with a `high`  or `moderate` severity

- `:vuln([cwe=1333])` returns only dependencies with a vulnerability that includes CWE-1333 (ReDoS)

#### [Attribute Selectors](https://developer
mozilla
org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors)

The attribute selector evaluates the key/value pairs in `package
json` if they are `String`s


- `[]` attribute selector (ie



- `[attribute~=value]` attribute value contains word



- `[attribute*=value]` attribute value contains string



- `[attribute|=value]` attribute value is equal to or starts with



- `[attribute^=value]` attribute value starts with



- `[attribute$=value]` attribute value ends with




#### `Array` & `Object` Attribute Selectors

The generic `:attr()` pseudo selector standardizes a pattern which can be used for attribute selection of `Object`s, `Array`s or `Arrays` of `Object`s accessible via `Arborist`'s `Node
package` metadata
 This allows for iterative attribute selection beyond top-level `String` evaluation
 The last argument passed to `:attr()` must be an `attribute` selector or a nested `:attr()`
 See examples below:

#### `Objects`

```css
/* return dependencies that have a `scripts
test` containing `""tap""` */
*:attr(scripts, [test~=tap])
```

#### Nested `Objects`

Nested objects are expressed as sequential arguments to `:attr()`


```css
/* return dependencies that have a testling config for opera browsers */
*:attr(testling, browsers, [~=opera])
```

#### `Arrays`

`Array`s specifically uses a special/reserved `
` character in place of a typical attribute name
 `Arrays` also support exact `value` matching when a `String` is passed to the selector


##### Example of an `Array` Attribute Selection:
```css
/* removes the distinction between properties & arrays */
/* ie
 we'd have to check the property & iterate to match selection */
*:attr([keywords^=react])
*:attr(contributors, :attr([name~=Jordan]))
```

##### Example of an `Array` matching directly to a value:
```css
/* return dependencies that have the exact keyword ""react"" */
/* this is equivalent to `*:keywords([value=""react""])` */
*:attr([keywords=react])
```

##### Example of an `Array` of `Object`s:
```css
/* returns */
*:attr(contributors, [email=ruyadorno@github
com])
```

### Groups

Dependency groups are defined by the package relationships to their ancestors (ie
 the dependency types that are defined in `package
json`)
 This approach is user-centric as the ecosystem has been taught to think about dependencies in these groups first-and-foremost
 Dependencies are allowed to be included in multiple groups (ex
 a `prod` dependency may also be a `dev` dependency (in that it's also required by another `dev` dependency) & may also be `bundled` - a selector for that type of dependency would look like: `*
dev
bundled`)


- `
prod`
- `
dev`
- `
peer`
- `
bundled`
- `
workspace`

Please note that currently `workspace` deps are always `prod` dependencies
  Additionally the `
root` dependency is also considered a `prod` dependency


### Programmatic Usage

- `Arborist`'s `Node` Class has a `
querySelectorAll()` method
  - this method will return a filtered, flattened dependency Arborist `Node` list based on a valid query selector

```js
const Arborist = require('@npmcli/arborist')
const arb = new Arborist({})
```

```js
// root-level
arb
loadActual()
then(async (tree) => {
  // query all production dependencies
  const results = await tree
querySelectorAll('
log(results)
})
```

```js
// iterative
arb
loadActual()
then(async (tree) => {
  // query for the deduped version of react
  const results = await tree
querySelectorAll(':type(git)')
  console
log(deps)
})
```

### Description

So, you've decided to use npm to develop (and maybe publish/deploy)
your project


Fantastic!

There are a few things that you need to do above the simple steps
that your users will do to install your program


### About These Documents

These are man pages
  If you install npm, you should be able to
then do `man npm-thing` to get the documentation on a particular
topic, or `npm help thing` to see the same information


### What is a Package

A package is:

* a) a folder containing a program described by a package
json file
* b) a gzipped tarball containing (a)
* c) a url that resolves to (b)
* d) a `<name>@<version>` that is published on the registry with (c)
* e) a `<name>@<tag>` that points to (d)
* f) a `<name>` that has a ""latest"" tag satisfying (e)
* g) a `git` url that, when cloned, results in (a)


Even if you never publish your package, you can still get a lot of
benefits of using npm if you just want to write a node program (a), and
perhaps if you also want to be able to easily install it elsewhere
after packing it up into a tarball (b)


Git urls can be of the form:

```bash
git://github
com/user/project
git#commit-ish
git+ssh://user@hostname:project
git#commit-ish
git+http://user@hostname/project/blah
git#commit-ish
git+https://user@hostname/project/blah
git#commit-ish
```

The `commit-ish` can be any tag, sha, or branch which can be supplied as
an argument to `git checkout`
  The default is whatever the repository uses
as its default branch


### The package
json File

You need to have a `package
json` file in the root of your project to do
much of anything with npm
  That is basically the whole interface


See [`package
json`](/configuring-npm/package-json) for details about what
goes in that file
  At the very least, you need:

* name: This should be a string that identifies your project
  Please do
  not use the name to specify that it runs on node, or is in JavaScript

  You can use the ""engines"" field to explicitly state the versions of node
  (or whatever else) that your program requires, and it's pretty well
  assumed that it's JavaScript


  It does not necessarily need to match your github repository name


  So, `node-foo` and `bar-js` are bad names
  `foo` or `bar` are better


* version: A semver-compatible version


* engines: Specify the versions of node (or whatever else) that your
  program runs on
  The node API changes a lot, and there may be bugs or
  new functionality that you depend on
  Be explicit


* author: Take some credit


* scripts: If you have a special compilation or installation script, then
  you should put it in the `scripts` object
  You should definitely have at
  least a basic smoke-test command as the ""scripts
test"" field
  See
  [scripts](/using-npm/scripts)


* main: If you have a single module that serves as the entry point to your
  program (like what the ""foo"" package gives you at require(""foo"")), then
  you need to specify that in the ""main"" field


* directories: This is an object mapping names to folders
  The best ones
  to include are ""lib"" and ""doc"", but if you use ""man"" to specify a folder
  full of man pages, they'll get installed just like these ones


You can use `npm init` in the root of your package in order to get you
started with a pretty basic package
json file
  See [`npm
init`](/commands/npm-init) for more info


### Keeping files *out* of your Package

Use a `
npmignore` file to keep stuff out of your package
  If there's no
`
gitignore` file, then npm will ignore
the stuff matched by the `
gitignore` file
  If you *want* to include
something that is excluded by your `
gitignore` file, you can create an
empty `
npmignore` file to override it
 Like `git`, `npm` looks for
`
npmignore` and `
gitignore` files in all subdirectories of your package,
not only the root directory


`
npmignore` files follow the [same pattern
rules](https://git-scm
com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring)
as `
gitignore` files:

* Blank lines or lines starting with `#` are ignored

* Standard glob patterns work

* You can end patterns with a forward slash `/` to specify a directory

* You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point `!`
npmignore` explicitly:

* `
*
swp`
* `
_*`
* `
DS_Store`
* `
git`
* `
gitignore`
* `
hg`
* `
npmignore`
* `
npmrc`
* `
lock-wscript`
* `
svn`
* `
wafpickle-*`
* `config
gypi`
* `CVS`
* `npm-debug
log`

Additionally, everything in `node_modules` is ignored, except for
bundled dependencies
 npm automatically handles this for you, so don't
bother adding `node_modules` to `
npmignore`
npmignore` is pointless:

* `package
json`
* `README` (and its variants)
* `CHANGELOG` (and its variants)
* `LICENSE` / `LICENCE`

If, given the structure of your project, you find `
npmignore` to be a
maintenance headache, you might instead try populating the `files`
property of `package
json`, which is an array of file or directory names
that should be included in your package
 Sometimes manually picking
which items to allow is easier to manage than building a block list


#### Testing whether your `
npmignore` or `files` config works

If you want to double check that your package will include only the files
you intend it to when published, you can run the `npm pack` command locally
which will generate a tarball in the working directory, the same way it
does for publishing


### Link Packages

`npm link` is designed to install a development package and see the
changes in real time without having to keep re-installing it
  (You do
need to either re-link or `npm rebuild -g` to update compiled packages,
of course
)

More info at [`npm link`](/commands/npm-link)


### Before Publishing: Make Sure Your Package Installs and Works

**This is important
**

If you can not install it locally, you'll have
problems trying to publish it
  Or, worse yet, you'll be able to
publish it, but you'll be publishing a broken or pointless package

So don't do that


In the root of your package, do this:

```bash
npm install 
 -g
```

That'll show you that it's working
  If you'd rather just create a symlink
package that points to your working directory, then do this:

```bash
npm link
```

Use `npm ls -g` to see if it's there


To test a local install, go into some other folder, and then do:

```bash
cd 

/some-other-folder
npm install 

/my-package
```

to install it locally into the node_modules folder in that other place


Then go into the node-repl, and try using require(""my-thing"") to
bring in your module's main module


### Create a User Account

Create a user with the adduser command
  It works like this:

```bash
npm adduser
```

and then follow the prompts


This is documented better in [npm adduser](/commands/npm-adduser)


### Publish your Package

This part's easy
  In the root of your folder, do this:

```bash
npm publish
```

You can give publish a url to a tarball, or a filename of a tarball,
or a path to a folder


Note that pretty much **everything in that folder will be exposed**
by default
  So, if you have secret stuff in there, use a
`
npmignore` file to list out the globs to ignore, or publish
from a fresh checkout


### Brag about it

Send emails, write blogs, blab in IRC


Tell the world how easy it is to install your program!

title: Logging
section: 7
description: Why, What & How We Log
---

### Description

The `npm` CLI has various mechanisms for showing different levels of information back to end-users for certain commands, configurations & environments


### Setting Log File Location

All logs are written to a debug log, with the path to that file printed if the execution of a command fails
 This can be changed with the `logs-dir` config option


For example, if you wanted to write all your logs to the current working directory, you could run: `npm install --logs-dir=
`
  This is especially helpful in debugging a specific `npm` issue as you can run
a command multiple times with different config values and then diff all the log files


Log files will be removed from the `logs-dir` when the number of log files exceeds `logs-max`, with the oldest logs being deleted first


To turn off logs completely set `--logs-max=0`


### Setting Log Levels

#### `loglevel`

`loglevel` is a global argument/config that can be set to determine the type of information to be displayed


The default value of `loglevel` is `""notice""` but there are several levels/types of logs available, including:

- `""silent""`
- `""error""`
- `""warn""`
- `""notice""`
- `""http""`
- `""info""`
- `""verbose""`
- `""silly""`

All logs pertaining to a level proceeding the current setting will be shown


##### Aliases

The log levels listed above have various corresponding aliases, including:

- `-d`: `--loglevel info`
- `--dd`: `--loglevel verbose`
- `--verbose`: `--loglevel verbose`
- `--ddd`: `--loglevel silly`
- `-q`: `--loglevel warn`
- `--quiet`: `--loglevel warn`
- `-s`: `--loglevel silent`
- `--silent`: `--loglevel silent`

#### `foreground-scripts`

The `npm` CLI began hiding the output of lifecycle scripts for `npm install` as of `v7`
 Notably, this means you will not see logs/output from packages that may be using ""install scripts"" to display information back to you or from your own project's scripts defined in `package
json`
 If you'd like to change this behavior & log this output you can set `foreground-scripts` to `true`


### Timing Information

The [`--timing` config](/using-npm/config#timing) can be set which does a few
things:

1
 Always shows the full path to the debug log regardless of command exit status
1
 Write timing information to a process specific timing file in the cache or `logs-dir`
1
 Output timing information to the terminal

This file contains a `timers` object where the keys are an identifier for the
portion of the process being timed and the value is the number of milliseconds it took to complete
 For
example, the performance might be affected by writing to the terminal
 In this case you can use
`--timing --silent` which will still write the timing file, but not output anything to the terminal
while running


### Registry Response Headers

#### `npm-notice`

The `npm` CLI reads from & logs any `npm-notice` headers that are returned from the configured registry
 This mechanism can be used by third-party registries to provide useful information when network-dependent requests occur


### Logs and Sensitive Information

The `npm` CLI makes a best effort to redact the following from terminal output and log files:

- Passwords inside basic auth URLs
- npm tokens

However, this behavior should not be relied on to keep all possible sensitive information redacted
 If you are concerned about secrets in your log file or terminal output, you can use `--loglevel=silent` and `--logs-max=0` to ensure no logs are written to your terminal or filesystem

### Description

There are three levels of org users:

1
 Super admin, controls billing & adding people to the org

2
 Team admin, manages team membership & package access

3
 Developer, works on packages they are given access to
  

The super admin is the only person who can add users to the org because it impacts the monthly bill
 The super admin will use the website to manage membership
 Every org has a `developers` team that all users are automatically added to


The team admin is the person who manages team creation, team membership, and package access for teams
 The team admin grants package access to teams, not individuals


The developer will be able to access packages based on the teams they are on
 Access is either read-write or read-only


There are two main commands:

1
 `npm team` see [npm team](/commands/npm-team) for more details
2
 `npm access` see [npm access](/commands/npm-access) for more details

### Team Admins create teams

* Check who you’ve added to your org:

```bash
npm team ls <org>:developers
```

* Each org is automatically given a `developers` team, so you can see the whole list of team members in your org
 This team automatically gets read-write access to all packages, but you can change that with the `access` command


* Create a new team:

```bash
npm team create <org:team>
```

* Add members to that team:

```bash
npm team add <org:team> <user>
```

### Publish a package and adjust package access

* In package directory, run

```bash
npm init --scope=<org>
```
to scope it for your org & publish as usual

* Grant access:  

```bash
npm access grant <read-only|read-write> <org:team> [<package>]
```

* Revoke access:

```bash
npm access revoke <org:team> [<package>]
```

### Monitor your package access

* See what org packages a team member can access:

```bash
npm access ls-packages <org> <user>
```

* See packages available to a specific team:

```bash
npm access ls-packages <org:team>
```

* Check which teams are collaborating on a package:

```bash
npm access ls-collaborators <pkg>
```

title: package-spec
section: 7
description: Package name specifier
---

### Description

Commands like `npm install` and the dependency sections in the
`package
json` use a package name specifier
  This can be many different
things that all refer to a ""package""
  Examples include a package name,
git url, tarball, or local directory
  These will generally be referred
to as `<package-spec>` in the help output for the npm commands that use
this package name specifier


### Package name

* `[<@scope>/]<pkg>`
* `[<@scope>/]<pkg>@<tag>`
* `[<@scope>/]<pkg>@<version>`
* `[<@scope>/]<pkg>@<version range>`

Refers to a package by name, with or without a scope, and optionally
tag, version, or version range
  This is typically used in combination
with the [registry](/using-npm/config#registry) config to refer to a
package in a registry


Examples:
* `npm`
* `@npmcli/arborist`
* `@npmcli/arborist@latest`
* `npm@6
13
1`
* `npm@^4
0
0`

### Aliases

* `<alias>@npm:<name>`

Primarily used by commands like `npm install` and in the dependency
sections in the `package
json`, this refers to a package by an alias

The `<alias>` is the name of the package as it is reified in the
`node_modules` folder, and the `<name>` refers to a package name as
found in the configured registry


See `Package name` above for more info on referring to a package by
name, and [registry](/using-npm/config#registry) for configuring which
registry is used when referring to a package by name


Examples:
* `semver:@npm:@npmcli/semver-with-patch`
* `semver:@npm:semver@7
2
2`
* `semver:@npm:semver@legacy`

### Folders

* `<folder>`

This refers to a package on the local filesystem
  Specifically this is
a folder with a `package
json` file in it
  This *should* always be
prefixed with a `/` or `
/` (or your OS equivalent) to reduce confusion

npm currently will parse a string with more than one `/` in it as a
folder, but this is legacy behavior that may be removed in a future
version


Examples:

* `
/my-package`
* `/opt/npm/my-package`

### Tarballs

* `<tarball file>`
* `<tarball url>`

Examples:

* `
/my-package
tgz`
* `https://registry
npmjs
org/semver/-/semver-1
0
0
tgz`

Refers to a package in a tarball format, either on the local filesystem
or remotely via url
  This is the format that packages exist in when
uploaded to a registry


### git urls

* `<git:// url>`
* `<github username>/<github project>`

Refers to a package in a git repo
  This can be a full git url, git
shorthand, or a username/package on GitHub
  You can specify a
git tag, branch, or other git ref by appending `#ref`


Examples:

* `https://github
com/npm/cli
git`
* `git@github
com:npm/cli
git`
* `git+ssh://git@github
com/npm/cli#v6
0
0`
* `github:npm/cli#HEAD`
* `npm/cli#c12ea07`

title: registry
section: 7
description: The JavaScript Package Registry
---

### Description

To resolve packages by name and version, npm talks to a registry website
that implements the CommonJS Package Registry specification for reading
package info


npm is configured to use the **npm public registry** at
<https://registry
npmjs
org> by default
 Use of the npm public registry is
subject to terms of use available at <https://docs
npmjs
com/policies/terms>


You can configure npm to use any compatible registry you like, and even run
your own registry
 Use of someone else's registry may be governed by their
terms of use


npm's package registry implementation supports several
write APIs as well, to allow for publishing packages and managing user
account information


The npm public registry is powered by a CouchDB database,
of which there is a public mirror at <https://skimdb
npmjs
com/registry>


The registry URL used is determined by the scope of the package (see
[`scope`](/using-npm/scope)
 If no scope is specified, the default registry is
used, which is supplied by the [`registry` config](/using-npm/config#registry)
parameter
  See [`npm config`](/commands/npm-config),
[`npmrc`](/configuring-npm/npmrc), and [`config`](/using-npm/config) for more on
managing npm's configuration

Authentication configuration such as auth tokens and certificates are configured
specifically scoped to an individual registry
 See
[Auth Related Configuration](/configuring-npm/npmrc#auth-related-configuration)

When the default registry is used in a package-lock or shrinkwrap it has the
special meaning of ""the currently configured registry""
 If you create a lock
file while using the default registry you can switch to another registry and
npm will install packages from the new registry, but if you create a lock
file while using a custom registry packages will be installed from that
registry even after you change to another registry


### Does npm send any information about me back to the registry?

Yes


When making requests of the registry npm adds two headers with information
about your environment:

* `Npm-Scope` – If your project is scoped, this header will contain its
  scope
 In the future npm hopes to build registry features that use this
  information to allow you to customize your experience for your
  organization

* `Npm-In-CI` – Set to ""true"" if npm believes this install is running in a
  continuous integration environment, ""false"" otherwise
 This is detected by
  looking for the following environment variables: `CI`, `TDDIUM`,
  `JENKINS_URL`, `bamboo
buildKey`
 If you'd like to learn more you may find
  the [original PR](https://github
com/npm/npm-registry-client/pull/129)
  interesting

  This is used to gather better metrics on how npm is used by humans, versus
  build farms


The npm registry does not try to correlate the information in these headers
with any authenticated accounts that may be used in the same requests


### How can I prevent my package from being published in the official registry?

Set `""private"": true` in your `package
json` to prevent it from being
published at all, or
`""publishConfig"":{""registry"":""http://my-internal-registry
local""}`
to force it to be published only to your internal/private registry


See [`package
json`](/configuring-npm/package-json) for more info on what goes in the package
json file


### Where can I find my (and others') published packages?

<https://www
npmjs
com/>

title: removal
section: 7
description: Cleaning the Slate
---

### Synopsis

So sad to see you go


```bash
sudo npm uninstall npm -g
```

Or, if that fails, get the npm source code, and do:

```bash
sudo make uninstall
```

### More Severe Uninstalling

Usually, the above instructions are sufficient
  That will remove
npm, but leave behind anything you've installed


If that doesn't work, or if you require more drastic measures,
continue reading


Note that this is only necessary for globally-installed packages
  Local
installs are completely contained within a project's `node_modules`
folder
  Delete that folder, and everything is gone unless a package's
install script is particularly ill-behaved


This assumes that you installed node and npm in the default place
  If
you configured node with a different `--prefix`, or installed npm with a
different prefix setting, then adjust the paths accordingly, replacing
`/usr/local` with your install prefix


To remove everything npm-related manually:

```bash
rm -rf /usr/local/{lib/node{,/
npm,_modules},bin,share/man}/npm*
```

If you installed things *with* npm, then your best bet is to uninstall
them with npm first, and then install them again once you have a
proper install
  This can help find any symlinks that are lying
around:

```bash
ls -laF /usr/local/{lib/node{,/
npm},bin,share/man} | grep npm
```

Prior to version 0
3, npm used shim files for executables and node
modules
  To track those down, you can do the following:

```bash
find /usr/local/{lib/node,bin} -exec grep -l npm \{\} \; ;
```

title: scope
section: 7
description: Scoped packages
---

### Description

All npm packages have a name
 Some package names also have a scope
 A scope
follows the usual rules for package names (URL-safe characters, no leading dots
or underscores)
 When used in package names, scopes are preceded by an `@` symbol
and followed by a slash, e
g


```bash
@somescope/somepackagename
```

Scopes are a way of grouping related packages together, and also affect a few
things about the way npm treats the package


Each npm user/organization has their own scope, and only you can add packages
in your scope
 This means you don't have to worry about someone taking your
package name ahead of you
 Thus it is also a good way to signal official packages
for organizations


Scoped packages can be published and installed as of `npm@2` and are supported
by the primary npm registry
 Unscoped packages can depend on scoped packages and
vice versa
 The npm client is backwards-compatible with unscoped registries,
so it can be used to work with scoped and unscoped registries at the same time


### Installing scoped packages

Scoped packages are installed to a sub-folder of the regular installation
folder, e
g
 if your other packages are installed in `node_modules/packagename`,
scoped modules will be installed in `node_modules/@myorg/packagename`
 The scope
folder (`@myorg`) is simply the name of the scope preceded by an `@` symbol, and can
contain any number of scoped packages


A scoped package is installed by referencing it by name, preceded by an
`@` symbol, in `npm install`:

```bash
npm install @myorg/mypackage
```

Or in `package
json`:

```json
""dependencies"": {
  ""@myorg/mypackage"": ""^1
3
0""
}
```

Note that if the `@` symbol is omitted, in either case, npm will instead attempt to
install from GitHub; see [`npm install`](/commands/npm-install)


### Requiring scoped packages

Because scoped packages are installed into a scope folder, you have to
include the name of the scope when requiring them in your code, e
g


```javascript
require('@myorg/mypackage')
```

There is nothing special about the way Node treats scope folders
 This
simply requires the `mypackage` module in the folder named `@myorg`


### Publishing scoped packages

Scoped packages can be published from the CLI as of `npm@2` and can be
published to any registry that supports them, including the primary npm
registry


(As of 2015-04-19, and with npm 2
0 or better, the primary npm registry
**does** support scoped packages
)

If you wish, you may associate a scope with a registry; see below


#### Publishing public scoped packages to the primary npm registry

Publishing to a scope, you have two options:

- Publishing to your user scope (example: `@username/module`)
- Publishing to an organization scope (example: `@org/module`)

If publishing a public module to an organization scope, you must
first either create an organization with the name of the scope
that you'd like to publish to or be added to an existing organization
with the appropriate permissions
 For example, if you'd like to
publish to `@org`, you would  need to create the `org` organization
on npmjs
com prior to trying to publish


Scoped packages are not public by default
  You will need to specify
`--access public` with the initial `npm publish` command
  This will publish
the package and set access to `public` as if you had run `npm access public`
after publishing
  You do not need to do this when publishing new versions of
an existing scoped package


#### Publishing private scoped packages to the npm registry

To publish a private scoped package to the npm registry, you must have
an [npm Private Modules](https://docs
npmjs
com/private-modules/intro)
account


You can then publish the module with `npm publish` or `npm publish
--access restricted`, and it will be present in the npm registry, with
restricted access
 You can then change the access permissions, if
desired, with `npm access` or on the npmjs
com website


### Associating a scope with a registry

Scopes can be associated with a separate registry
 This allows you to
seamlessly use a mix of packages from the primary npm registry and one or more
private registries, such as [GitHub Packages](https://github
com/features/packages) or the open source [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio
org)
project


You can associate a scope with a registry at login, e
g


```bash
npm login --registry=http://reg
example
com --scope=@myco
```

Scopes have a many-to-one relationship with registries: one registry can
host multiple scopes, but a scope only ever points to one registry


You can also associate a scope with a registry using `npm config`:

```bash
npm config set @myco:registry=http://reg
example
com
```

Once a scope is associated with a registry, any `npm install` for a package
with that scope will request packages from that registry instead
 Any
`npm publish` for a package name that contains the scope will be published to
that registry instead

title: scripts
section: 7
description: How npm handles the ""scripts"" field
---

### Description

The `""scripts""` property of your `package
json` file supports a number
of built-in scripts and their preset life cycle events as well as
arbitrary scripts
 These all can be executed by running
`npm run-script <stage>` or `npm run <stage>` for short
 *Pre* and *post*
commands with matching names will be run for those as well (e
g
 `premyscript`,
`myscript`, `postmyscript`)
 Scripts from dependencies can be run with
`npm explore <pkg> -- npm run <stage>`


### Pre & Post Scripts

To create ""pre"" or ""post"" scripts for any scripts defined in the
`""scripts""` section of the `package
json`, simply create another script
*with a matching name* and add ""pre"" or ""post"" to the beginning of them


```json
{
  ""scripts"": {
    ""precompress"": ""{{ executes BEFORE the `compress` script }}"",
    ""compress"": ""{{ run command to compress files }}"",
    ""postcompress"": ""{{ executes AFTER `compress` script }}""
  }
}
```

In this example `npm run compress` would execute these scripts as
described


### Life Cycle Scripts

There are some special life cycle scripts that happen only in certain
situations
 These scripts happen in addition to the `pre<event>`, `post<event>`, and
`<event>` scripts


* `prepare`, `prepublish`, `prepublishOnly`, `prepack`, `postpack`, `dependencies`

**prepare** (since `npm@4
0
0`)
* Runs BEFORE the package is packed, i
e
 during `npm publish`
    and `npm pack`
* Runs on local `npm install` without any arguments
* Runs AFTER `prepublish`, but BEFORE `prepublishOnly`

* NOTE: If a package being installed through git contains a `prepare`
 script, its `dependencies` and `devDependencies` will be installed, and
 the prepare script will be run, before the package is packaged and
 installed


* As of `npm@7` these scripts run in the background

  To see the output, run with: `--foreground-scripts`


**prepublish** (DEPRECATED)
* Does not run during `npm publish`, but does run during `npm ci`
  and `npm install`
 See below for more info


**prepublishOnly**
* Runs BEFORE the package is prepared and packed, ONLY on `npm publish`


**prepack**
* Runs BEFORE a tarball is packed (on ""`npm pack`"", ""`npm publish`"", and when installing a git dependency)

* NOTE: ""`npm run pack`"" is NOT the same as ""`npm pack`""
 ""`npm run pack`"" is an arbitrary user defined script name, where as, ""`npm pack`"" is a CLI defined command


**postpack**
* Runs AFTER the tarball has been generated but before it is moved to its final destination (if at all, publish does not save the tarball locally)

**dependencies**
* Runs AFTER any operations that modify the `node_modules` directory IF changes occurred

* Does NOT run in global mode

#### Prepare and Prepublish

**Deprecation Note: prepublish**

Since `npm@1
1
71`, the npm CLI has run the `prepublish` script for both `npm publish` and `npm install`, because it's a convenient way to prepare a package for use (some common use cases are described in the section below)
  It has also turned out to be, in practice, [very confusing](https://github
com/npm/npm/issues/10074)
  As of `npm@4
0
0`, a new event has been introduced, `prepare`, that preserves this existing behavior
 A _new_ event, `prepublishOnly` has been added as a transitional strategy to allow users to avoid the confusing behavior of existing npm versions and only run on `npm publish` (for instance, running the tests one last time to ensure they're in good shape)


See <https://github
com/npm/npm/issues/10074> for a much lengthier justification, with further reading, for this change


**Use Cases**

If you need to perform operations on your package before it is used, in a way that is not dependent on the operating system or architecture of the target system, use a `prepublish` script
 This includes tasks such as:

* Compiling CoffeeScript source code into JavaScript

* Creating minified versions of JavaScript source code

* Fetching remote resources that your package will use


The advantage of doing these things at `prepublish` time is that they can be done once, in a single place, thus reducing complexity and variability
 Additionally, this means that:

* You can depend on `coffee-script` as a `devDependency`, and thus
  your users don't need to have it installed

* You don't need to include minifiers in your package, reducing
  the size for your users

* You don't need to rely on your users having `curl` or `wget` or
  other system tools on the target machines


#### Dependencies

The `dependencies` script is run any time an `npm` command causes changes to the `node_modules` directory
 It is run AFTER the changes have been applied and the `package
json` and `package-lock
json` files have been updated


### Life Cycle Operation Order

#### [`npm cache add`](/commands/npm-cache)

* `prepare`

#### [`npm ci`](/commands/npm-ci)

* `preinstall`
* `install`
* `postinstall`
* `prepublish`
* `preprepare`
* `prepare`
* `postprepare`

 These all run after the actual installation of modules into
 `node_modules`, in order, with no internal actions happening in between

#### [`npm diff`](/commands/npm-diff)

* `prepare`

#### [`npm install`](/commands/npm-install)

These also run when you run `npm install -g <pkg-name>`

* `preinstall`
* `install`
* `postinstall`
* `prepublish`
* `preprepare`
* `prepare`
* `postprepare`

If there is a `binding
gyp` file in the root of your package and you
haven't defined your own `install` or `preinstall` scripts, npm will
default the `install` command to compile using node-gyp via `node-gyp
rebuild`

These are run from the scripts of `<pkg-name>`

#### [`npm pack`](/commands/npm-pack)

* `prepack`
* `prepare`
* `postpack`

#### [`npm publish`](/commands/npm-publish)

* `prepublishOnly`
* `prepack`
* `prepare`
* `postpack`
* `publish`
* `postpublish`

#### [`npm rebuild`](/commands/npm-rebuild)

* `preinstall`
* `install`
* `postinstall`
* `prepare`

`prepare` is only run if the current directory is a symlink (e
g
 with
linked packages)

#### [`npm restart`](/commands/npm-restart)

If there is a `restart` script defined, these events are run, otherwise
`stop` and `start` are both run if present, including their `pre` and
`post` iterations)

* `prerestart`
* `restart`
* `postrestart`

#### [`npm run <user defined>`](/commands/npm-run-script)

* `pre<user-defined>`
* `<user-defined>`
* `post<user-defined>`

#### [`npm start`](/commands/npm-start)

* `prestart`
* `start`
* `poststart`

If there is a `server
js` file in the root of your package, then npm
will default the `start` command to `node server
js`
  `prestart` and
`poststart` will still run in this case


#### [`npm stop`](/commands/npm-stop)

* `prestop`
* `stop`
* `poststop`

#### [`npm test`](/commands/npm-test)

* `pretest`
* `test`
* `posttest`

#### [`npm version`](/commands/npm-version)

* `preversion`
* `version`
* `postversion`

#### A Note on a lack of [`npm uninstall`](/commands/npm-uninstall) scripts

While npm v6 had `uninstall` lifecycle scripts, npm v7 does not
 Removal of a package can happen for a wide variety of reasons, and there's no clear way to currently give the script enough context to be useful


Reasons for a package removal include:

* a user directly uninstalled this package
* a user uninstalled a dependant package and so this dependency is being uninstalled
* a user uninstalled a dependant package but another package also depends on this version
* this version has been merged as a duplicate with another version
* etc


Due to the lack of necessary context, `uninstall` lifecycle scripts are not implemented and will not function


### User

When npm is run as root, scripts are always run with the effective uid
and gid of the working directory owner


### Environment

Package scripts run in an environment where many pieces of information
are made available regarding the setup of npm and the current state of
the process


#### path

If you depend on modules that define executable scripts, like test
suites, then those executables will be added to the `PATH` for
executing the scripts
  So, if your package
json has this:

```json
{
  ""name"" : ""foo"",
  ""dependencies"" : {
    ""bar"" : ""0
1
x""
  },
  ""scripts"": {
    ""start"" : ""bar 
/test""
  }
}
```

then you could run `npm start` to execute the `bar` script, which is
exported into the `node_modules/
bin` directory on `npm install`


#### package
json vars

The package
json fields are tacked onto the `npm_package_` prefix
 So,
for instance, if you had `{""name"":""foo"", ""version"":""1
2
5""}` in your
package
json file, then your package scripts would have the
`npm_package_name` environment variable set to ""foo"", and the
`npm_package_version` set to ""1
2
5""
  You can access these variables
in your code with `process
env
npm_package_name` and
`process
env
npm_package_version`, and so on for other fields


See [`package
json`](/configuring-npm/package-json) for more on package configs


#### current lifecycle event

Lastly, the `npm_lifecycle_event` environment variable is set to
whichever stage of the cycle is being executed
 So, you could have a
single script used for different parts of the process which switches
based on what's currently happening


Objects are flattened following this format, so if you had
`{""scripts"":{""install"":""foo
js""}}` in your package
json, then you'd
see this in the script:

```bash
process
env
npm_package_scripts_install === ""foo
js""
```

### Examples

For example, if your package
json contains this:

```json
{
  ""scripts"" : {
    ""install"" : ""scripts/install
js"",
    ""postinstall"" : ""scripts/install
js""
  }
}
```

then `scripts/install
js` will be called for the install and post-install
stages of the lifecycle
  Since `scripts/install


If you want to run a make command, you can do so
  This works just
fine:

```json
{
  ""scripts"" : {
    ""preinstall"" : ""
/configure"",
    ""install"" : ""make && make install"",
    ""test"" : ""make test""
  }
}
```

### Exiting

Scripts are run by passing the line as a script argument to `sh`


If the script exits with a code other than 0, then this will abort the
process


Note that these script files don't have to be Node
js or even
JavaScript programs
 They just have to be some kind of executable
file


### Best Practices

* Don't exit with a non-zero error code unless you *really* mean it

  If the failure is minor or only will prevent some optional features, then
  it's better to just print a warning and exit successfully

* Try not to use scripts to do what npm can do for you
  Read through
  [`package
json`](/configuring-npm/package-json) to see all the things that you can specify and enable
  by simply describing your package appropriately

* Inspect the env to determine where to put things
  For instance, if
  the `npm_config_binroot` environment variable is set to `/home/user/bin`, then
  don't try to install executables into `/usr/local/bin`

* Don't prefix your script commands with ""sudo""
  If root permissions
  are required for some reason, then it'll fail with that error, and
  the user will sudo the npm command in question

* Don't use `install`
 Use a `
gyp` file for compilation, and `prepare`
  for anything else
 You should almost never have to explicitly set a
  preinstall or install script
 If you are doing this, please consider if
  there is another option
 The only valid use of `install` or `preinstall`
  scripts is for compilation which must be done on the target architecture

* Scripts are run from the root of the package folder, regardless of what the
  current working directory is when `npm` is invoked
 If you want your
  script to use different behavior based on what subdirectory you're in, you
  can use the `INIT_CWD` environment variable, which holds the full path you
  were in when you ran `npm run`

title: workspaces
section: 7
description: Working with workspaces
---

### Description

**Workspaces** is a generic term that refers to the set of features in the
npm cli that provides support for managing multiple packages from your local
file system from within a singular top-level, root package


This set of features makes up for a much more streamlined workflow handling
linked packages from the local file system
 It automates the linking process
as part of `npm install` and removes the need to manually use `npm link` in
order to add references to packages that should be symlinked into the current
`node_modules` folder


We also refer to these packages being auto-symlinked during `npm install` as a
single **workspace**, meaning it's a nested package within the current local
file system that is explicitly defined in the [`package
json`](/configuring-npm/package-json#workspaces)
`workspaces` configuration


### Defining workspaces

Workspaces are usually defined via the `workspaces` property of the
[`package
json`](/configuring-npm/package-json#workspaces) file, e
g:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""my-workspaces-powered-project"",
  ""workspaces"": [
    ""packages/a""
  ]
}
```

Given the above `package
json` example living at a current working
directory `
` that contains a folder named `packages/a` that itself contains
a `package
json` inside it, defining a Node
js package, e
g:

```


+-- package
json
`-- packages
   +-- a
   |   `-- package
json
```

The expected result once running `npm install` in this current working
directory `
` is that the folder `packages/a` will get symlinked to the
`node_modules` folder of the current working dir


Below is a post `npm install` example, given that same previous example
structure of files and folders:

```


+-- node_modules
|  `-- a -> 

/packages/a
+-- package-lock
json
+-- package
json
`-- packages
   +-- a
   |   `-- package
json
```

### Getting started with workspaces

You may automate the required steps to define a new workspace using
[npm init](/commands/npm-init)
 For example in a project that already has a
`package
json` defined you can run:

```
npm init -w 
/packages/a
```

This command will create the missing folders and a new `package
json`
file (if needed) while also making sure to properly configure the
`""workspaces""` property of your root project `package
json`


### Adding dependencies to a workspace

It's possible to directly add/remove/update dependencies of your workspaces
using the [`workspace` config](/using-npm/config#workspace)


For example, assuming the following structure:

```


+-- package
json
`-- packages
   +-- a
   |   `-- package
json
   `-- b
       `-- package
json
```

If you want to add a dependency named `abbrev` from the registry as a
dependency of your workspace **a**, you may use the workspace config to tell
the npm installer that package should be added as a dependency of the provided
workspace:

```
npm install abbrev -w a
```

Note: other installing commands such as `uninstall`, `ci`, etc will also
respect the provided `workspace` configuration


### Using workspaces

Given the [specifics of how Node
js handles module resolution](https://nodejs
org/dist/latest-v14
x/docs/api/modules
html#modules_all_together) it's possible to consume any defined workspace
by its declared `package
json` `name`
 Continuing from the example defined
above, let's also create a Node
js script that will require the workspace `a`
example module, e
g:

```
// 
/packages/a/index
js
module
exports = 'a'

// 
/lib/index
js
const moduleA = require('a')
console
log(moduleA) // -> a
```

When running it with:

`node lib/index
js`

This demonstrates how the nature of `node_modules` resolution allows for
**workspaces** to enable a portable workflow for requiring each **workspace**
in such a way that is also easy to [publish](/commands/npm-publish) these
nested workspaces to be consumed elsewhere


### Running commands in the context of workspaces

You can use the `workspace` configuration option to run commands in the context
of a configured workspace

Additionally, if your current directory is in a workspace, the `workspace`
configuration is implicitly set, and `prefix` is set to the root workspace


Following is a quick example on how to use the `npm run` command in the context
of nested workspaces
 For a project containing multiple workspaces, e
g:

```


+-- package
json
`-- packages
   +-- a
   |   `-- package
json
   `-- b
       `-- package
json
```

By running a command using the `workspace` option, it's possible to run the
given command in the context of that specific workspace
 e
g:

```
npm run test --workspace=a
```

You could also run the command within the workspace


```
cd packages/a && npm run test
```

Either will run the `test` script defined within the
`
/packages/a/package
json` file


Please note that you can also specify this argument multiple times in the
command-line in order to target multiple workspaces, e
g:

```
npm run test --workspace=a --workspace=b
```

Or run the command for each workspace within the 'packages' folder:
```
npm run test --workspace=packages
```

It's also possible to use the `workspaces` (plural) configuration option to
enable the same behavior but running that command in the context of **all**
configured workspaces
 e
g:

```
npm run test --workspaces
```

Will run the `test` script in both `
/packages/a` and `
/packages/b`


Commands will be run in each workspace in the order they appear in your `package
json`

```
{
  ""workspaces"": [ ""packages/a"", ""packages/b"" ]
}
```

Order of run is different with:

```
{
  ""workspaces"": [ ""packages/b"", ""packages/a"" ]
}
```

### Ignoring missing scripts

It is not required for all of the workspaces to implement scripts run with the `npm run` command


By running the command with the `--if-present` flag, npm will ignore workspaces missing target script


```
npm run test --workspaces --if-present
```

## Example for SOCKS 'associate' command

The associate command tells the SOCKS proxy server to establish a UDP relay
 The server binds to a new UDP port and communicates the newly opened port back to the origin client
 From here, any SOCKS UDP frame packets sent to this special UDP port on the Proxy server will be forwarded to the desired destination, and any responses will be forwarded back to the origin client (you)


This can be used for things such as DNS queries, and other UDP communicates


**Connection Steps**

1
 Client -(associate)-> Proxy (Tells the proxy to create a UDP relay and bind on a new port)
2
 Client <-(port)- Proxy (Tells the origin client which port it opened and is accepting UDP frame packets on)

At this point the proxy is accepting UDP frames on the specified port


3
 Client --(udp frame) -> Proxy -> Destination (The origin client sends a UDP frame to the proxy on the UDP port, and the proxy then forwards it to the destination specified in the UDP frame
)
4
 Client <--(udp frame) <-- Proxy <-- Destination (The destination client responds to the udp packet sent in #3)

## Usage

The 'associate' command can only be used by creating a new SocksClient instance and listening for the 'established' event


**Note:** UDP packets relayed through the proxy servers are encompassed in a special Socks UDP frame format
 SocksClient
createUDPFrame() and SocksClient
parseUDPFrame() create and parse these special UDP packets


```typescript
const dgram = require('dgram');
const SocksClient = require('socks')
SocksClient;

// Create a local UDP socket for sending/receiving packets to/from the proxy

const udpSocket = dgram
createSocket('udp4');
udpSocket
bind();

// Listen for incoming UDP packets from the proxy server

udpSocket
on('message', (message, rinfo) => {
  console
log(SocksClient
parseUDPFrame(message));
  /*
  { frameNumber: 0,
    remoteHost: { host: '8
8
8
8', port: 53 }, // The remote host that replied with a UDP packet
    data: <Buffer 74 65 73 74 0a> // The data
  }
  */
});

const options = {
  proxy: {
    host: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  // This should be the ip and port of the expected client that will be sending UDP frames to the newly opened UDP port on the server

  // Most SOCKS servers accept 0
0
0
0 as a wildcard address to accept UDP frames from any source

  destination: {
    host: '0
0
0
0',
    port: 0
  },

  command: 'associate'
};

const client = new SocksClient(options);

// This event is fired when the SOCKS server has started listening on a new UDP port for UDP relaying

client
on('established', info => {
  console


>,
    remoteHost: { // This is the remote port on the SOCKS proxy server to send UDP frame packets to

      host: '104
131
124
203',
      port: 58232
    }
  }
  */

  // Send a udp frame to 8
8
8
8 on port 53 through the proxy

  const packet = SocksClient
createUDPFrame({
    remoteHost: { host: '8
8
8
8', port: 53 },
    data: Buffer
from('hello') // A DNS lookup in the real world

  });

  // Send packet

  udpSocket
send(packet, info
remoteHost
port, info
remoteHost
host);
});

// SOCKS proxy failed to bind

client
on('error', () => {
  // Handle errors
});
```

# socks examples

## Example for SOCKS 'bind' command

The bind command tells the SOCKS proxy server to bind and listen on a new TCP port for an incoming connection
 It communicates the newly opened port back to the origin client
 Once a incoming connection is accepted by the SOCKS proxy server it then communicates the remote host that connected to the SOCKS proxy back through the same initial connection via the origin client


This can be used for things such as FTP clients which require incoming TCP connections, etc


**Connection Steps**

1
 Client -(bind)-> Proxy    (Tells the proxy to bind to a new port)
2
 Client <-(port)- Proxy    (Tells the origin client which port it opened)
3
 Client2 --> Proxy    (Other client connects to the proxy on this port)
4
 Client <--(client2's host info)  (Proxy tells the origin client who connected to it)
5
 Original connection to the proxy is now a full TCP stream between client (you) and client2

6
 Client <--> Proxy <--> Client2


## Usage

The 'bind' command can only be used by creating a new SocksClient instance and listening for 'bound' and 'established' events



```typescript
const SocksClient = require('socks')
SocksClient;

const options = {
  proxy: {
    host: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  // This should be the ip and port of the expected client that will connect to the SOCKS proxy server on the newly bound port

  // Most SOCKS servers accept 0
0
0
0 as a wildcard address to accept any client

  destination: {
    host: '0
0
0
0',
    port: 0
  },

  command: 'bind'
};

const client = new SocksClient(options);

// This event is fired when the SOCKS server has started listening on a new port for incoming connections

client
on('bound', (info) => {
  console


>,
    remoteHost: { // This is the remote ip and port of the SOCKS proxy that is now accepting incoming connections

      host: '104
131
124
203',
      port: 49928
    }
  }
  */
});

// This event is fired when the SOCKS server has accepted an incoming connection on the newly bound port

client
on('established', (info) => {
  console


>,
    remoteHost: { // This is the remote ip and port that connected to the SOCKS proxy on the newly bound port

      host: '1
2
3
4',
      port: 58232
    }
  }
  */

  // At this point info
socket is a regular net
Socket TCP connection between client and client2 (1
2
3
4) (the client which connected to the proxy on the newly bound port
)

  console
socket);
  // <Socket 


>  (this is a raw net
Socket that is established to the destination host through the given proxy servers)
});

// SOCKS proxy failed to bind

client
on('error', () => {
  // Handle errors
});
```
# socks examples

## Example for SOCKS 'connect' command

The connect command is the most common use-case for a SOCKS proxy
 This establishes a direct connection to a destination host through a proxy server
 The destination host only has knowledge of the proxy server connecting to it and does not know about the origin client (you)


**Origin Client (you) <-> Proxy Server <-> Destination Server**

In this example, we are connecting to a web server on port 80, and sending a very basic HTTP request to receive a response
 It's worth noting that there are many socks-http-agents that can be used with the node http module (and libraries such as request
js) to make this easier
 This HTTP request is used as a simple example


The 'connect' command can be used via the SocksClient
createConnection() factory function as well as by creating a SocksClient instance and using event handlers


### Using createConnection with async/await

Since SocksClient
createConnection returns a Promise, we can easily use async/await for flow control


```typescript
const SocksClient = require('socks')
SocksClient;

const options  = {
  proxy: {
    host: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  destination: {
    host: 'ip-api
com', // host names are supported with SOCKS v4a and SOCKS v5

    port: 80
  },

  command: 'connect'
};

async function start() {
  try {
    const info = await SocksClient
createConnection(options);

    console
socket);
    // <Socket 


>  (this is a raw net
Socket that is established to the destination host through the given proxy servers)

    info
socket
write('GET /json HTTP/1
1\nHost: ip-api
com\n\n');
    info
socket
on('data', (data) => {
      console
log(data
toString()); // ip-api
com sees that the last proxy (104
131
124
203) is connected to it and not the origin client (you)

```

### Using createConnection with Promises

```typescript
const SocksClient = require('socks')
SocksClient;

const options  = {
  proxy: {
    ipaddress: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  destination: {
    host: 'ip-api

  command: 'connect'
};

SocksClient
createConnection(options)

then(info => {

### Using createConnection with callbacks

SocksClient
createConnection() optionally accepts a callback function as a second parameter


**Note:** If a callback function is provided, a Promise is still returned from the function, but the promise will always resolve regardless of if there was en error
 (tldr: Do not mix callbacks and Promises)


```typescript
const SocksClient = require('socks')
SocksClient;

const options  = {
  proxy: {
    ipaddress: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  destination: {
    host: 'ip-api
com', // host names are supported with SOCKS v4a and SOCKS v5

    port: 80
  },

  command: 'connect'
};

SocksClient
socket);
    // <Socket

    info
socket
write('GET /json HTTP/1

    info
socket
on('data', (data) => {
      console
log(data
toString()); // ip-api
com sees that the last proxy (104
131
124
203) is connected to it and not the origin client (you)

SocksClient also supports instance creation of a SocksClient
 This allows for event based flow control


```typescript
const SocksClient = require('socks')
SocksClient;

const options  = {

    ipaddress: '104

const client = new SocksClient(options);

# socks examples

## Example for SOCKS 'associate' command

The associate command tells the SOCKS proxy server to establish a UDP relay
 The server binds to a new UDP port and communicates the newly opened port back to the origin client
 From here, any SOCKS UDP frame packets sent to this special UDP port on the Proxy server will be forwarded to the desired destination, and any responses will be forwarded back to the origin client (you)


This can be used for things such as DNS queries, and other UDP communicates


**Connection Steps**

1
 Client -(associate)-> Proxy (Tells the proxy to create a UDP relay and bind on a new port)
2
 Client <-(port)- Proxy (Tells the origin client which port it opened and is accepting UDP frame packets on)

At this point the proxy is accepting UDP frames on the specified port


3
 Client --(udp frame) -> Proxy -> Destination (The origin client sends a UDP frame to the proxy on the UDP port, and the proxy then forwards it to the destination specified in the UDP frame
)
4
 Client <--(udp frame) <-- Proxy <-- Destination (The destination client responds to the udp packet sent in #3)

## Usage

The 'associate' command can only be used by creating a new SocksClient instance and listening for the 'established' event


**Note:** UDP packets relayed through the proxy servers are packaged in a special Socks UDP frame format
 SocksClient
createUDPFrame() and SocksClient
parseUDPFrame() create and parse these special UDP packets


```typescript
import * as dgram from 'dgram';
import { SocksClient, SocksClientOptions } from 'socks';

// Create a local UDP socket for sending/receiving packets to/from the proxy

const udpSocket = dgram
createSocket('udp4');
udpSocket
bind();

// Listen for incoming UDP packets from the proxy server

udpSocket
on('message', (message, rinfo) => {
  console
log(SocksClient
parseUDPFrame(message));
  /*
  { frameNumber: 0,
    remoteHost: { host: '8
8
8
8', port: 53 }, // The remote host that replied with a UDP packet
    data: <Buffer 74 65 73 74 0a> // The data
  }
  */
});

const options: SocksClientOptions = {
  proxy: {
    host: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  // This should be the ip and port of the expected client that will be sending UDP frames to the newly opened UDP port on the server

  // Most SOCKS servers accept 0
0
0
0 as a wildcard address to accept UDP frames from any source

  destination: {
    host: '0
0
0
0',
    port: 0
  },

  command: 'associate'
};

const client = new SocksClient(options);

// This event is fired when the SOCKS server has started listening on a new UDP port for UDP relaying

client
on('established', info => {
  console


>,
    remoteHost: { // This is the remote port on the SOCKS proxy server to send UDP frame packets to

      host: '104
131
124
203',
      port: 58232
    }
  }
  */

  // Send a udp frame to 8
8
8
8 on port 53 through the proxy

  const packet = SocksClient
createUDPFrame({
    remoteHost: { host: '8
8
8
8', port: 53 },
    data: Buffer
from('hello') // A DNS lookup in the real world

  });

  // Send packet

  udpSocket
send(packet, info
remoteHost
port, info
remoteHost
host);
});

// SOCKS proxy failed to bind

client
on('error', () => {
  // Handle errors
});

// Start connection
client
connect();
```

# socks examples

## Example for SOCKS 'bind' command

The bind command tells the SOCKS proxy server to bind and listen on a new TCP port for an incoming connection
 It communicates the newly opened port back to the origin client
 Once a incoming connection is accepted by the SOCKS proxy server it then communicates the remote host that connected to the SOCKS proxy back through the same initial connection via the origin client


This can be used for things such as FTP clients which require incoming TCP connections, etc


**Connection Steps**

1
 Client -(bind)-> Proxy    (Tells the proxy to bind to a new port)
2
 Client <-(port)- Proxy    (Tells the origin client which port it opened)
3
 Client2 --> Proxy    (Other client connects to the proxy on this port)
4
 Client <--(client2's host info)  (Proxy tells the origin client who connected to it)
5
 Original connection to the proxy is now a full TCP stream between client (you) and client2

6
 Client <--> Proxy <--> Client2


## Usage

The 'bind' command can only be used by creating a new SocksClient instance and listening for 'bound' and 'established' events



```typescript
import { SocksClient, SocksClientOptions } from 'socks';

const options: SocksClientOptions = {
  proxy: {
    host: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  // This should be the ip and port of the expected client that will connect to the SOCKS proxy server on the newly bound port

  // Most SOCKS servers accept 0
0
0
0 as a wildcard address to accept any client

  destination: {
    host: '0
0
0
0',
    port: 0
  },

  command: 'bind'
};

const client = new SocksClient(options);

// This event is fired when the SOCKS server has started listening on a new port for incoming connections

client
on('bound', (info) => {
  console


>,
    remoteHost: { // This is the remote ip and port of the SOCKS proxy that is now accepting incoming connections

      host: '104
131
124
203',
      port: 49928
    }
  }
  */
});

// This event is fired when the SOCKS server has accepted an incoming connection on the newly bound port

client
on('established', (info) => {
  console


>,
    remoteHost: { // This is the remote ip and port that connected to the SOCKS proxy on the newly bound port

      host: '1
2
3
4',
      port: 58232
    }
  }
  */

  // At this point info
socket is a regular net
Socket TCP connection between client and client2 (1
2
3
4) (the client which connected to the proxy on the newly bound port
)

  console
socket);
  // <Socket 


>  (this is a raw net
Socket that is established to the destination host through the given proxy servers)
});

// SOCKS proxy failed to bind

client
on('error', () => {
  // Handle errors
});

// Start connection
client
connect();
```
# socks examples

## Example for SOCKS 'connect' command

The connect command is the most common use-case for a SOCKS proxy
 This establishes a direct connection to a destination host through a proxy server
 The destination host only has knowledge of the proxy server connecting to it and does not know about the origin client (you)


**Origin Client (you) <-> Proxy Server <-> Destination Server**

In this example, we are connecting to a web server on port 80, and sending a very basic HTTP request to receive a response
 It's worth noting that there are many socks-http-agents that can be used with the node http module (and libraries such as request
js) to make this easier
 This HTTP request is used as a simple example


The 'connect' command can be used via the SocksClient
createConnection() factory function as well as by creating a SocksClient instance and using event handlers


### Using createConnection with async/await

Since SocksClient
createConnection returns a Promise, we can easily use async/await for flow control


```typescript
import { SocksClient, SocksClientOptions } from 'socks';

const options: SocksClientOptions = {
  proxy: {
    host: '104
131
124
203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  destination: {
    host: 'ip-api
com', // host names are supported with SOCKS v4a and SOCKS v5

    port: 80
  },

  command: 'connect'
};

async function start() {
  try {
    const info = await SocksClient
createConnection(options);

    console
socket);
    // <Socket 


>  (this is a raw net
Socket that is established to the destination host through the given proxy servers)

    info
socket
write('GET /json HTTP/1
1\nHost: ip-api
com\n\n');
    info
socket
on('data', (data) => {
      console
log(data
toString()); // ip-api
com sees that the last proxy (104
131
124
203) is connected to it and not the origin client (you)

## Migrating from v1

For the most part, migrating from v1 takes minimal effort as v2 still supports factory creation of proxy connections with callback support


### Notable breaking changes

- In an options object, the proxy 'command' is now required and does not default to 'connect'

- **In an options object, 'target' is now known as 'destination'
**
- Sockets are no longer paused after a SOCKS connection is made, so socket
resume() is no longer required
 (Please be sure to attach data handlers immediately to the Socket to avoid losing data)

- In v2, only the 'connect' command is supported via the factory SocksClient
createConnection function
 (BIND and ASSOCIATE must be used with a SocksClient instance via event handlers)

- In v2, the factory SocksClient
createConnection function callback is called with a single object rather than separate socket and info object

- A SOCKS http/https agent is no longer bundled into the library


For informational purposes, here is the original getting started example from v1 converted to work with v2


### Before (v1)

```javascript
var Socks = require('socks');

var options = {
    proxy: {
        ipaddress: ""202
101
228
108"",
        port: 1080,
        type: 5
    },
    target: {
        host: ""google
com"",
        port: 80
    },
    command: 'connect'
};

Socks
createConnection(options, function(err, socket, info) {
    if (err)
        console
log(err);
    else {
        socket
write(""GET / HTTP/1
1\nHost: google
com\n\n"");
        socket
on('data', function(data) {
            console
log(data
length);
            console
log(data);
        });

        // PLEASE NOTE: sockets need to be resumed before any data will come in or out as they are paused right before this callback is fired

        socket
resume();

        // 569
        // <Buffer 48 54 54 50 2f 31 2e 31 20 33 30 31 20 4d 6f 76 65 64 20 50 65



    }
});
```

### After (v2)
```javascript
const SocksClient = require('socks')
SocksClient;

let options = {
    proxy: {
        ipaddress: ""202
101
228
108"",
        port: 1080,
        type: 5
    },
    destination: {
        host: ""google

### Javascript porting of Markus Kuhn's wcwidth() implementation

The following explanation comes from the original C implementation:

This is an implementation of wcwidth() and wcswidth() (defined in
IEEE Std 1002
1-2001) for Unicode


http://www
opengroup
org/onlinepubs/007904975/functions/wcwidth

 Interoperability between terminal-line
applications and (teletype-style) character terminals using the
UTF-8 encoding requires agreement on which character should advance
the cursor by how many cell positions
 No established formal
standards exist at present on which Unicode character shall occupy
how many cell positions on character terminals
 These routines are
a first attempt of defining such behavior based on simple rules
applied to data provided by the Unicode Consortium


For some graphical characters, the Unicode standard explicitly
defines a character-cell width via the definition of the East Asian
FullWidth (F), Wide (W), Half-width (H), and Narrow (Na) classes

In all these cases, there is no ambiguity about which width a
terminal shall use
 For characters in the East Asian Ambiguous (A)
class, the width choice depends purely on a preference of backward
compatibility with either historic CJK or Western practice

Choosing single-width for these characters is easy to justify as
the appropriate long-term solution, as the CJK practice of
displaying these characters as double-width comes from historic
implementation simplicity (8-bit encoded characters were displayed
single-width and 16-bit ones double-width, even for Greek,
Cyrillic, etc


Much less clear is the choice of width for the Not East Asian
(Neutral) class
 Existing practice does not dictate a width for any
of these characters
 It would nevertheless make sense
typographically to allocate two character cells to characters such
as for instance EM SPACE or VOLUME INTEGRAL, which cannot be
represented adequately with a single-width glyph
 The following
routines at present merely assign a single-cell width to all
neutral characters, in the interest of simplicity
 This is not
entirely satisfactory and should be reconsidered before
establishing a formal standard in this area
 At the moment, the
decision which Not East Asian (Neutral) characters should be
represented by double-width glyphs cannot yet be answered by
applying a simple rule from the Unicode database content
 Setting
up a proper standard for the behavior of UTF-8 character terminals
will require a careful analysis not only of each Unicode character,
but also of each presentation form, something the author of these
routines has avoided to do so far

However, in practice, this resulted in audits often failing to properly
detect meta-vulnerabilities, because the tree would appear to be invalid
due to missing dependencies, and prevented the detection of vulnerabilities
in package trees that used git dependencies or private modules
  Note that this is typically
  unnecessary, as npm's cache is self-healing and resistant to data

You must be the package owner to deprecate something

This will make sure to generate your react app as expected, one important
consideration to have in mind is that `npm exec` is going to be run in the
context of the newly created folder for that workspace, and that's the reason
why in this example the initializer uses the initializer name followed with a

If the field value you are querying for is a property of an object, you should run:

Some special files and directories are also included or excluded regardless
of whether they exist in the `files` array (see below)
  It should not
be a URL to an html project page that you put in your browser


### Hidden Lockfiles

In order to avoid processing the `node_modules` folder repeatedly, npm as
of v7 uses a ""hidden"" lockfile present in
`node_modules/

Java(TM) Cryptography Extension Policy Files
    for the Java(TM) Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment

                               README
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Import and export control rules on cryptographic software vary from
country to country
  The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) architecture
allows flexible cryptographic key strength to be configured via the
jurisdiction policy files which are referenced by the ""crypto
policy""
security property in the <java-home>/conf/security/java
security file


By default, Java provides two different sets of cryptographic policy
files:

    unlimited:  These policy files contain no restrictions on cryptographic
                strengths or algorithms

    limited:    These policy files contain more restricted cryptographic
                strengths

These files reside in <java-home>/conf/security/policy in the ""unlimited""
or ""limited"" subdirectories respectively


Each subdirectory contains a complete policy configuration,
and subdirectories can be added/edited/removed to reflect your
import or export control product requirements


Within a subdirectory, the effective policy is the combined minimum
permissions of the grant statements in the file(s) matching the filename
pattern ""default_*
policy""
  At least one grant is required
  For example:

    limited   =  Export (all) + Import (limited)  =  Limited
    unlimited =  Export (all) + Import (all)      =  Unlimited

The effective exemption policy is the combined minimum permissions
of the grant statements in the file(s) matching the filename pattern
""exempt_*
policy""
  Exemption grants are optional
  For example:

    limited   =  grants exemption permissions, by which the
                 effective policy can be circumvented

                 e
g
  KeyRecovery/KeyEscrow/KeyWeakening


Please see the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) documentation for
additional information on these files and formats


YOU ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT YOUR EXPORT/IMPORT CONTROL COUNSEL OR ATTORNEY
TO DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS


Please note that the JCE for Java SE, including the JCE framework,
cryptographic policy files, and standard JCE providers provided with
the Java SE, have been reviewed and approved for export as mass market
encryption item by the US Bureau of Industry and Security

the terms of this License

License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License
 You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form


3
2
 Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3
1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License


3
3
 Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software
 If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s)


3
4
 Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies


3
5
 Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software
 However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor


4
 Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect
 Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License
 Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it


5
 Termination
--------------

5
1
 The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms
 However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance
 Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice


5
2
 If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2
1 of this License shall terminate


5
3
 In the event of termination under Sections 5
1 or 5
2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination

Introduction
============

  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project


  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license
  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least


  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike
 However, we will be
      interested in any kind of bug reports
 (`as is' distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us
  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code
 (`credits')

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products



  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license
  We thus
  encourage you to use the following text:

   """"""
    Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
    Project (www
freetype
org)
  All rights reserved

   """"""

  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
  actually use



Legal Terms
===========

0
 Definitions
--------------

  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
  beta or final release


  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'

  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
  engine'


  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive

  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this


  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg
  All rights reserved except as
  specified below

  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
  herein, subject to the following conditions:

    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file

      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
      files


    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation
  We also
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory


  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files
   If you use
  our work, you  must acknowledge us
  However, no  fee need be paid
  to us


3
 Advertising
--------------

  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
  purposes without specific prior written permission


  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'


  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
  accept  it
   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it

  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
  of this license

License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users
  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it
  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead
)  You can apply it to
your programs, too


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price
  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it


  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code
  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights


  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software
  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations


  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents
  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary
  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow


		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License
  The ""Program"", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program""
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language
  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ""modification""
)  Each licensee is addressed as ""you""


Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope
  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program)

Whether that is true depends on what the Program does


  1
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee


  2
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change


    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License


    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License
  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License


  3
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code
  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it
  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable
  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable


If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code


  4
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License
  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance


  5
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works
  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it


  6
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions
  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License


  7
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License
  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all
  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License


  8
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded
  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License


  9
  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns


Each version is given a distinguishing version number
  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any
later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation
  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation


  10
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission
  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this
  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally


  12
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES


		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms


  To do so, attach the following notices to the program
  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found


    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does
>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version


    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details


    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc
, 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail


If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'

    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details


The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License
  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program


You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if
necessary
  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc
, hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker


  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs
  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library
  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License

(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed,

(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation

(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind


These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library
  If you use our work, you ought to

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name

ansi2knr
c is included in this distribution by permission of L
 Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA

ansi2knr
c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it

(See the file ansi2knr
c for full details
)  However, since ansi2knr
c is
not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not
limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do


The Unix configuration script ""configure"" was produced with GNU Autoconf

It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable

The same holds for its supporting scripts (config
guess, config
sub,
ltconfig, ltmain
sh)
  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M
I
T
 but is also freely distributable


It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered
by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi
  Hence arithmetic coding
cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses
  For this
reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free
JPEG software
 (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain
over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many
implementations will support it
) So far as we are aware, there are
no patent restrictions on the remaining code


The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files


We are required to state that ""The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2
1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc

 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed


[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL
  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2
1
]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it
  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users


  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it
  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price
  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it


  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code
  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it
  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights


  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library


  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library
  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others


  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program
  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder
  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license


  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License
  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License
  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs


  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library
  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom
  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library


  We call this license the ""Lesser"" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License
  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs
  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries
  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances


  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard
  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library
  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries
  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License


  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software
  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system


  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow
  Pay close attention to the difference between a
""work based on the library"" and a ""work that uses the library""
  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run


                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0
 This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called ""this License"")

Each licensee is addressed as ""you""


  A ""library"" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables


  The ""Library"", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms
  A ""work based on the
Library"" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language
  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term ""modification""
)

  ""Source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it
  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library


  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope
  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it)
  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does


  1
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library


  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee


  2
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library


    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change


    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License


    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful
  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License


  3
 You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library
  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License
  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish
)  Do not make any other change in
these notices


  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy


  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library


  4
 You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange


  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code


  5
 A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a ""work that uses the Library""
  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License


  However, linking a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a ""work that uses the
library""
  The executable is therefore covered by this License

Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables


  When a ""work that uses the Library"" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not

Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library


  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work
  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6
)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6

Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself


  6
 As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications


  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License
  You must supply a copy of this License
  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License
  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable ""work that
    uses the Library"", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library
  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions
)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library
  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with


    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution


    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place


    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy


  For an executable, the required form of the ""work that uses the
Library"" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it
  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable


  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system
  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute


  7
 You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities
  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above


    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work


  8
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License
  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License
  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance


  9
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works
  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it


  10
 Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions
  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License


  11
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License
  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all
  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License


  12
 If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded
  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License


  13

Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns


Each version is given a distinguishing version number
  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
""any later version"", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation
  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation


  14
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission
  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this
  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally
  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU
  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION


  16
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES


                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change
  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License)


  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library
  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found


    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does
>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2
1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version


    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details


    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc
, 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail


You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the library, if
necessary
  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc
, hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker


  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

 A copy of the license is included in the section entitled “GNU Free Documentation License”
Version 1
3, 3 November 2008Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc
 https://fsf
org/Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially
This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense
 It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does
 But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book
 We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License
 Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein
 The “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work
 Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”
 You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law
A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language
A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject
 (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics
) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them
The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License
 If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant
 The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections
 If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none
The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License
 A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words
A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters
 A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent
 A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification
 Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG
 Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only
The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page
The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public
A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language
 (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”
) To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License
 You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute
 However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies
 If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover
 Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies
 The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible
 You may add other material on the covers in addition
 Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material
 If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it
 In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant
 To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice
 These titles must be distinct from any other section titles
You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version
 Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity
 If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy
 If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number
 Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History” in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”
 You must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements”
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit
 When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form
 Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4
 Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections
 You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers
 In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail
If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License
 Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License
 If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns
 See https://www
gnu
org/licenses/
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number
 If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation
 If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation
 If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document
“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works
 A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server
 A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site
“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3
0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization
“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document
An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the “with … Texts
” line with this:If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software
","

By signing up for Telegram, you accept our Privacy Policy and agree not to:We reserve the right to update these Terms of Service later
Citizens of EU countries and the United Kingdom must be at least 18 years old to sign up
If you access certain optional features and services on the Telegram platform, you will be additionally bound by their specific terms – such as the Terms of Service for Telegram Stars, Telegram Premium, Telegram Business, Bot Users, Mini App Users, Revenue Sharing with Content Creators, Telegram API Developers and Bot Developers
Telegram users can acquire Telegram Stars, which are used to purchase digital goods and services from bots and mini-apps inside the Telegram app
 Should you wish to use Telegram Stars, you in turn accept the Terms of Service for Telegram Stars
Telegram is a free application that provides a wide range of services, including unlimited cloud storage, 2 GB file uploads, audio and video calls, group chats up to 200,000 members, support for multiple devices, and more, free of charge
 Some additional services, such as Telegram Premium, may be available for purchase in certain countries – offering an even more powerful messaging experience and a chance to support the continuing development of the Telegram platform
Telegram Premium is a subscription membership that unlocks exclusive features and improved functionality
 By purchasing Telegram Premium, you agree that you are authorizing recurring monthly or yearly payments, which will be made to Telegram using the payment method you selected until the subscription is canceled by you or Telegram
You can manage your Telegram Premium subscription by accessing the Telegram Premium section in the Settings of your Telegram account
 If your payment method is declined, you must provide new payment information or your Telegram Premium subscription will be canceled
 If you provide new payment information and are successfully charged, your new subscription period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge
Users in certain regions may be required to pay local taxes, which will be calculated and added to the total cost of a purchase
 Payment providers may apply their own commissions and conversion rates to payments in various currencies
 This is outside of Telegram’s control
You can cancel Telegram Premium any time
 To cancel your subscription, follow the instructions in the Telegram Premium section in the Settings of your Telegram account
 If you purchased Telegram Premium using your Apple ID, you can cancel your subscription through your device's Account Settings or in the Manage Subscriptions section of the Apple App Store
 If you purchased Telegram Premium using Google Play, you can cancel your subscriptions by visiting the Subscriptions section of Google Play
 At the end of your subscription you will lose access to all features associated with Telegram Premium
Deleting your Telegram account or removing the Telegram application from your device does not cancel your subscription
If you obtain a Telegram Premium subscription via a third party (e
g
 Google Play, Apple App Store), your purchase may be further subject to the third party's terms as agreed between you and the third party
By issuing a chargeback or refund request for Premium subscriptions paid for through a third party, you agree to allow Telegram to release necessary data to that third party regarding your account status and Telegram Premium purchases
Failure to comply with the Telegram Terms of Service may result in a temporary or a permanent ban from Telegram or some of its services
 In such instances, you might lose the benefits of Telegram Premium and we will not compensate you for this loss
Telegram can decide to stop offering subscriptions at any time, including in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond our control, or to comply with a legal requirement; in this case we will cancel your subscription and refund the prorated portion of any prepaid subscription fee equal to the remaining unused term of the subscription
You are responsible for all applicable taxes, data plans, internet fees, and other fees associated with your use of Telegram
 It is not possible to get a “partial refund” or credit if a user wishes to cancel their recurring subscription early – it will remain valid until the end of its purchased duration
While we do not anticipate frequent changes to the price of Telegram Premium, we reserve the right to change both these terms and the fees in effect on renewal of your subscription, to reflect factors such as changes to our business, different product offerings, or new economic conditions
We will give you no less than 30 days' advance notice of any material changes via a message to your Telegram account and you will have the opportunity to cancel your subscription before the new fee comes into effect
 Any correspondence from the Telegram Team about a user’s Premium account will be sent via verified service accounts in the Telegram app
Messages from Telegram about your Premium account will contain relevant information about your subscription or payment status – not special offers or promotions
The services included in the Telegram Premium subscription (“Premium Services”) are listed in the Premium Section
 From time to time, we may add new items into the Premium Services, including limited-time or promotional access to additional paid features and subscriptions, such as Telegram Business
 In such cases, your access to those features is further subject to their specific Terms of Service
We may also remove some of the existing Premium Services if we are no longer able to provide them for legal or technical reasons
 In addition, some Premium Services may become free of charge for all Telegram users in the future or be offered as a separate membership tier
Telegram strives to make its services available for all users all the time, but occasional technical issues may occur, temporarily preventing us from delivering services, including Premium Services, to our users
 Telegram will not compensate you for any direct or indirect loss resulting from our temporary inability to provide any free or paid services
Premium Services are available on major Telegram clients, such as the official iOS and Android apps
 Some Telegram apps made by Telegram or by third parties may not offer all Premium Services immediately after they are launched or at all
Some Premium Services may require the latest version of the Telegram application to be installed on your device
 In some cases, users you interact with may also need to have the latest version of the Telegram application installed on their devices in order to be able to view the content you share with them by the use of Premium Services
 For example, exclusive stickers available only to the Telegram Premium subscribers or documents larger than 2 GB may be correctly viewed only by users with an up-to-date version of Telegram
In general, users you interact with will not have to purchase a Telegram Premium subscription in order to view the content you share with them by the use of Premium Services
Premium Services include the optional ability to request the conversion of any video and voice message on Telegram to text
 Additionally, the services include optional live translation for any chat, group or channel
These technologies are still evolving and there is no guarantee that every message you attempt to either transcribe or translate will be processed correctly, or at all
 The accuracy and availability of these technologies depend on a third party (Google LLC, subsidiary of Alphabet Inc
Read more about the privacy of this data in our Privacy PolicyPremium Services include increased download speed of media and documents on Telegram
 This increase is allowed by the removal of all relevant speed limits on Telegram’s side
 However, your actual download speed will also depend on external factors such as your hardware, your internet provider and certain intermediary connectivity providers
 Therefore, there is no guarantee that enabling Premium Services will always affect the speed with which you download documents and media on Telegram
In certain countries Telegram shows sponsored messages in one-to-many channels that have over 1000 subscribers
 The subscribers of Telegram Premium won't see such sponsored messages displayed by Telegram
 However, channels on Telegram are managed by other users, their administrators, who may publish their own content featuring third-party promotions or sponsorships
 These ads are not part of the Telegram advertisement platform and subscribers of Telegram Premium may still see them
Premium Services provide users with a number of “boosts” which they can assign to channels to contribute to increasing the level of these channels, with each level unlocking or extending certain features for the channel
A purchased Telegram Premium subscription provides 4 boosts
 Gifted subscriptions provide 1 boost to the gift recipient and 3 boosts to the gifter
 Telegram Premium subscriptions distributed via giveaways in channels do not provide boosts to the accounts that activate them and instead boost the channel which organized the giveaway
Channel admins can organize giveaways at their expense, purchasing a number of premium subscriptions to be distributed among present or future subscribers and immediately gain 4 boosts per purchased subscription
 The boosts received by the channel can’t be reassigned to another channel, they are activated the moment the giveaway is first launched and remain active for the purchased duration of the subscriptions distributed in the giveaway
Telegram selects winners based on the criteria that channel administrators choose when setting up the giveaway
 In the rare chance that a technical issue results in an unintended outcome, Telegram will attempt to rectify the situation but makes no guarantees to the organizers of a giveaway or its participants
Winners of a giveaway will receive a shareable link that contains a unique gift code which confirms that they won and activates a Telegram Premium subscription, but does not provide any boosts for the user account that activated it
Giveaways are available for purchase on Telegram’s store apps, direct and web versions and on Fragment
 Prices may vary between each option
 If there are not enough eligible participants to distribute all the prizes, the channel admins will receive all the undistributed premium activation links, to be used at the admins’ discretion
 Undistributed prizes cannot be “rolled over” into other giveaways
Admins who sponsored a giveaway are not entitled to a refund if they lose access to their channel
Channels that mislead users into joining by means of giveaways that are later refunded with a third party (e
g
 Subscribers gained as a result of such actions may be removed from the channel sponsoring the giveaway, all channels listed in the selection criteria and other associated channels at our sole discretion
Certain countries or jurisdictions may impose regulatory constraints on giveaways
 If you run a giveaway, you are solely responsible for complying with applicable law
 You explicitly acknowledge that Telegram is not liable in the event of sanctions, fees, and any form of legal or administrative action incurred as a result of or in relation to your use of the “Giveaway” feature provided by Telegram
Channel admins can use the Giveaway feature to announce arbitrary prizes in addition to premium subscriptions
 Should they choose to do so, they are solely responsible for delivering said prizes to giveaway winners
 Telegram will not be liable if any disputes arise in relation to the prizes, their delivery or lack thereof

    or is under common control with Licensee
  Control means (i) beneficial
    ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the voting securities of a
    corporation or other business organization with voting securities, or (ii)
    a fifty percent (50%) or greater interest in the profits and capital of a
    partnership or other business organization without voting securities,
    provided that no other individual or entity other than the Licensee also
    has an equal fifty percent (50%) ownership or interest in the legal entity

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless MathWorks provides its express
    written consent to treat the entity as an Affiliate, an Affiliate shall not
    include any entity to which MathWorks has expressly refused to license (or
    grant access under a license to) its software products or any entity that
    had a license for MathWorks software products that MathWorks expressly
    terminated
   

    23
2
 ""Application"" means binary executable software that runs
    independently of the Programs, consisting of one or more software files
    that Licensee has created by either (a) using a Program to compile or
    translate Licensee created Source Code or (b) incorporating or linking any
    part of any compiled Source Code, library file, or other Program Component
    provided with the Program
  An Application must contain original code
    developed by Licensee and must provide substantial functionality not
    contained in, or provided by, the Program Components that are incorporated
    into such Application
  If a software file created by a Licensee
    incorporates Program Components, but does not meet the requirements of the
    previous two sentences, then it is a Derivative Form (as defined below)
  

    23
3
 ""Application License"" means a license for an Application that
    contains terms and conditions that (a) are at least as restrictive as the
    terms and conditions of this Agreement; (b) explicitly exclude MathWorks
    and its Licensors from all liability for damages or remedies; (c) do not
    provide a warranty for any Program; (d) do not transfer or convey any use
    or deployment rights for any Program without MathWorks' consent; and (e)

    disclaimer or warning notice included on or embedded in any part of the
    deployed Application
 Further, if Licensee's Application is generated with
    the MATLAB Compiler, then Licensee's Application License shall include or
    incorporate by reference the terms of the MATLAB Runtime License included
    in a text file at [MCR Install Directory]\[version_number]\MCR_license
txt
    located within the installation for the MATLAB Runtime


    23

5
 ""Derivative Form"" means one or more software files that Licensee has
    derived from one or more Program Components (including without limitation
    by incorporating, translating, or modifying, in whole or in part, any
    Program Component), and which, if modified or copied without MathWorks'
    authorization, would constitute a copyright infringement or breach of the
    Agreement
  A software file created by Licensee which qualifies as an
    ""Application"" under the above definition shall not be deemed a Derivative

Part Two: Deployment Rights 

The Software License Agreement grants a Licensee and its Licensed Users (""you"")
the limited rights to install and use Programs in accordance with the License
Offering you acquire
 The Software License Agreement does not grant you the
right to modify or distribute Programs or Program Components or create
derivative works
 This Part Two sets forth additional limited rights to modify,
create derivative works of, and/or distribute certain Program Components as
specifically set forth below
 

Certain Programs, such as the Compiler Programs and the Coder Programs,
generate output in the form of Source Code, Object Code, or other files and
materials
  For example, MATLAB Compiler and Simulink Compiler can be used to
create an executable program, and MATLAB Coder and other Coder Programs can be
used to generate Source Code in C and C++
 Under certain circumstances
described below, you are permitted to use and distribute the files, models,
Applications, and Generated Forms that you create using the Programs
 

Some Programs are technically prevented from being compiled, distributed,
called from an external application, or used with MATLAB Parallel Server
 

All rights described below are limited by the restrictions of your License
Offering, this Program Offering Guide, and the Software License Agreement
 

1
 Deployment Rights for User Files

You may distribute or sublicense User Files without restriction, provided that
a principal purpose of the distribution or sublicense is not to replace or
replicate a Program or any part of a Program and you otherwise comply with the
general restrictions of the Software License Agreement and your License
Offering
  ""User Files"" are MATLAB code files, Simulink model files, files
generated by RoadRunner Programs, MEX-files, MAT-files, VHDL-files,
Verilog-files, FIG-files or P-files that you create and that do not include any
code obtained from MATLAB code files, Simulink model files, MAT-files,
VHDL-files, Verilog-files, TLC-files, P-code, C/C++ files or other Source Code
files supplied with the Programs

  Deployment Rights for Derivative Forms

Your rights to create, use and distribute Derivative Forms are limited to those
rights expressly set forth in this Section 2


You may distribute Derivative Forms to Third Parties only (a) as expressly
permitted in Section 3
4 (API Code) below, or (b) if the Third Party is bound
by a Software License Agreement with MathWorks that requires such Third Party
to treat such Derivative Forms received from you as its own Derivative Form
under its Software License Agreement
 

If you receive software that is a Derivative Form under a Third Party's
Software License Agreement with MathWorks, or would otherwise be a Derivative
Form under the terms of your Software License Agreement, then you must treat
such software as a Derivative Form as if you modified or generated the software
yourself


3
 Deployment Rights for Generated Forms and Applications

Your rights to create, use and distribute Generated Forms and Applications are
limited to those rights expressly set forth in this Section 3
 

No further license or royalty fees shall be due to MathWorks for deployment as
expressly permitted in this Section, regardless of whether the deployment is
solely for your Internal Operations or to Third Parties
 

    3
1
 Compiler Programs

    If you license a Compiler Program, you may create and deploy Applications
    generated by the Compiler Program that meet the requirements of this Section
    and comply with the restrictions in the Software License Agreement
 

    These Applications may include compiled versions of MATLAB code files or
    Simulink model files, but only as required for the Application and from
    Programs that you have licensed
 You may also use and distribute the MATLAB
    Runtime together with these Applications for the sole purpose of running
    the Applications
  However, you are prohibited from making copies of the
    MATLAB Runtime accessible to any Third Party separate from or for use other
    than with your Application, and from providing the MATLAB Runtime for
    service bureau or similar service use


    If you license Parallel Computing Toolbox (PCT) and generate an
    Application using any functionality of PCT, that Application may enable
    up to the number of worker instances provided by PCT used to build the
    Application
 End-users of your Application do not need to have a license to
    PCT
 

    Your exercise of any of the rights granted here is subject to the
    restrictions in the Software License Agreement, including the following:

    i) You may not distribute any library header files
 

    ii) You may not use your Application to enable access to the code
    generation capabilities of Programs or the capabilities of other
    Transformation Programs


    iii) Your Application may not provide capability similar to the
    capabilities of any of Programs, or provide functionality or behavior
    similar to that of the MATLAB command line or scripting and programming
    capabilities
 Your Application also may not enable evaluation of end-user
    code or expressions


    iv) Your Application may not provide access to all or a substantial portion
    of a Program
 

    v) You must include the notice ""MATLAB(r)
 (c) 1984 - [INSERT YEAR MATLAB
    VERSION PUBLISHED] The MathWorks, Inc
"" in your Application's About Box, or

 Coder Programs

    This Section discusses the deployment rights MathWorks grants you in
    conjunction with your license and use of the Coder Programs: 1) MATLAB
    Coder, 2) Simulink Coder, 3) Embedded Coder, 4) HDL Coder, 5) Filter Design
    HDL Coder, 6) Simulink PLC Coder, and 7) GPU Coder


    The Coder Programs take content that you choose to input
 Depending on the
    Coder Program you use, the input could be a Simulink model, a Stateflow
    diagram, or MATLAB code
 The Coder Program then converts this input to code
    in C/C++, VHDL/Verilog or PLC structured text
  You may copy and deploy 
    these Generated Forms for use outside of the Programs


    In order to enable this output code to work, each of these Coder Programs
    will link in certain files proprietary to MathWorks, which may include C,
    C++, Assembly, linker command files, template makefiles, project files, or
    TLC source code files
 You may only copy, modify, and deploy these
    proprietary MathWorks files in Source Code or Linked Object Code form for
    different development targets when used with the Coder Programs or with
    code generated by the Coder Programs as part of, and only as required by, a
    larger standalone application
 A standalone application is an Application
    created using programming languages and tools other than the Programs,
    which executes outside of the Programs


    3
3
 Simulink Real-Time

    You may use Simulink Real-Time to develop Applications that include Object
    Code derived from Program Components of Simulink Real-Time that are
    required by the Application and that have been compiled or otherwise
    obtained from Simulink Coder on a single development Computer, download
    that Application to a target Computer, and distribute that Application
    beyond the target Computer
 

    3
4
 API Code

    Programs you license may include selected Source Code and shared Object
    Code library files that implement various documented application
    programming interface (API) capabilities


    You may use and modify such Source Code files solely for creation of your
    own Application
 You may copy and distribute Object Code compiled from this
    Source Code, but only as either a standalone Object Code file or Object
    Code linked to your Application, and only for use with and deployment of
    your own Application


    You may use, copy and distribute shared Object Code library files from the

    CALs are only offered for Standard Licenses and only with an Annual term


    If a Licensee is using a Transformation Program to process Program Input
    Artifacts in an Automation Server, or calling a Transformation Program from
    an External Application: 
    
    * For Transformation Programs in the MATLAB and Simulink product
      families, the Licensee's total number of licenses (including CALs) for
      the Transformation Program must be no less than the number of MATLAB or
      Simulink licenses used to create or modify the Program Input Artifacts
 

    * For Transformation Programs in the MATLAB and Simulink product families
      licensed under the Concurrent License Option, the Licensee's total number
      of licenses (including CALs) for the Transformation Program may instead
      be based on the number of Licensed Users of MATLAB or Simulink licenses
      used to create or modify the Program Input Artifacts


    * For Transformation Programs in the MATLAB and Simulink product families
      licensed under the Enterprise License Option, each user's total desktop
      usage of the Transformation Program (including CALs for such
      Transformation Program), must be no less than such user's total desktop
      usage of the MATLAB or Simulink licenses used to create or modify the
      Program Input Artifacts processed by such Transformation Program


    Examples:

    1
 Licensee uses MATLAB to create or modify MATLAB files processed by
    MATLAB Compiler in an Automation Server or External Application


    * If Licensee has 5 Individual licenses of MATLAB and 2 Individual licenses
      of MATLAB Compiler, Licensee needs to purchase 3 Individual MATLAB
      Compiler CALs

    * If Licensee has 5 Individual licenses of MATLAB and 5 Individual licenses
      of MATLAB Compiler, no CALs are needed



    2

-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others


The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves
 The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works
 The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license
 The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives


DEFINITIONS
""Font Software"" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such
 This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation


""Original Version"" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s)


""Modified Version"" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the

new environment


""Author"" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software

in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself


2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,

 These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user
 This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users


4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the

permission


5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license

          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
          distribution titled ""LEGAL"" which describes the claim and the
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
          know whom to contact
 If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3
2,
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained


          (b) Contributor APIs

          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
LICENSE (""AGREEMENT"")
 ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT


1
 DEFINITIONS

""Contribution"" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor
 A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf
 Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program


""Contributor"" means any person or entity that distributes the Program


""Licensed Patents "" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program


""Program"" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement


""Recipient"" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors


2
 GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
derivative works, in source code and object code form


b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form

This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents
 The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution
 No hardware per se is licensed hereunder


c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
property rights of any other entity
 As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any

For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
before distributing the Program


d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set
forth in this Agreement


3
 REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or
through a medium customarily used for software exchange
 

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program
 

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
Program


Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution


4
 COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like
 While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors
 Therefore, if
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor (""Commercial Contributor"") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering
 In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations


For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X
 That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor
 If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone
 Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages


5
 Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations


6
 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES


7


If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed
 In
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed


All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance

Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable
 However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive

order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner
 The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time

Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number
 The Program (including
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received
 In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
Contributions) under the new version

2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise

============================================================================
License 
Lua is free software distributed under the terms of the MIT license reproduced here
 No paperwork, no royalties, no GNU-like ""copyleft"" restrictions, either
 Just download it and use it
 
Lua is certified Open Source software
 Its license is simple and liberal and is compatible with GPL
 Lua is not in the public domain and PUC-Rio keeps its copyright
 
The spirit of the Lua license is that you are free to use Lua for any purpose at no cost without having to ask us
 The only requirement is that if you do use Lua, then you should give us credit by including the copyright notice somewhere in your product or its documentation
 A nice, but optional, way to give us further credit is to include a Lua logo and a link to our site in a web page for your product
 
The Lua language is entirely designed, implemented, and maintained by a team at PUC-Rio in Brazil
 The implementation is not derived from licensed software
 
Before Lua 5
0, Lua used its own license, which was very close to the zlib license and others, but not quite the same
 Check the source distribution for the exact license text for each version before Lua 5
0
 Nevertheless, if you wish to use those old versions, you may hereby assume that they have all been re-licensed under the MIT license as described above

License

Lua is free software distributed under the terms of the MIT license reproduced here
 No paperwork, no royalties, no GNU-like ""copyleft"" restrictions, either
 Just download it and use it


Lua is certified Open Source software
 [osi certified]Its license is simple and liberal and is compatible with GPL
 Lua is not in the public domain and PUC-Rio keeps its copyright


The spirit of the Lua license is that you are free to use Lua for any purpose at no cost without having to ask us
 The only requirement is that if you do use Lua, then you should give us credit by including the copyright notice somewhere in your product or its documentation
 A nice, but optional, way to give us further credit is to include a Lua logo and a link to our site in a web page for your product


The Lua language is entirely designed, implemented, and maintained by a team at PUC-Rio in Brazil
 The implementation is not derived from licensed software


Before Lua 5
0, Lua used its own license, which was very close to the zlib license and others, but not quite the same
 Check the source distribution for the exact license text for each version before Lua 5
0
 Nevertheless, if you wish to use those old versions, you may hereby assume that they have all been re-licensed under the MIT license as described above

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE
Version 1
1 - 26 February 2007


PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others


The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves
 The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works
 The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license
 The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives



DEFINITIONS

""Font Software"" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such
 This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation


""Original Version"" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s)


""Modified Version"" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting - in part or in whole - any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment


""Author"" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software



PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself


2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license
 These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user
 This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users


4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission


5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license
 The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created

PCRE2 LICENCE
-------------

PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language


Releases 10
00 and above of PCRE2 are distributed under the terms of the ""BSD""
licence, as specified below, with one exemption for certain binary
redistributions
 The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the ""doc"" directory,
is distributed under the same terms as the software itself
 The data in the
testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain


The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding
 Also
included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to
optimize pattern matching
 This is an optional feature that can be omitted when
the library is built

      contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
      software without specific prior written permission



EXEMPTION FOR BINARY LIBRARY-LIKE PACKAGES
------------------------------------------

The second condition in the BSD licence (covering binary redistributions) does
not apply all the way down a chain of software
 If binary package A includes
PCRE2, it must respect the condition, but if package B is software that
includes package A, the condition is not imposed on package B unless it uses
PCRE2 independently

Sqlite
https://www

https://github
com/cznic/sqlite/blob/master/SQLITE-LICENSE
=====================================================================================

SQLite Is Public Domain

All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public
domain by the authors
 All code authors, and representatives of the companies
they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the
public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe
at the main offices of Hwaci
 Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use,
compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code
form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,
and by any means


The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in
SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship
with a larger application
 Some scripts used as part of the build process (for
example the ""configure"" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other
open-source licenses
 Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final
deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those
scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the
SQLite library


All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch
 Every line of
code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have
public domain dedications on file
 So the SQLite code base is clean and is
uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc
,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed


                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it
  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users
  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it
  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead
)  You can apply it to
your programs, too


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price
  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it


  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code
  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights


  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software
  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations


  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents
  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary
  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow


                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License
  The ""Program"", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program""
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language
  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ""modification""
)  Each licensee is addressed as ""you""


Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope
  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program)

Whether that is true depends on what the Program does


  1
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program


You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee


  2
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change


    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License


    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License
  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement
)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole
  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works
  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License


  3
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code
  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above
)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it
  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable
  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable


If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code


  4
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License
  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance


  5
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works
  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it


  6
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions
  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License


  7
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License
  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all
  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program


If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances


It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices
  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice


This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License


  8
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded
  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License


  9
  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns


Each version is given a distinguishing version number
  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any
later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation
  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation


  10
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission
  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this
  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally


  12
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES


                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms


  To do so, attach the following notices to the program
  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ""copyright"" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found


    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does
>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2
    as published by the Free Software Foundation


    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details


    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc
,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail


If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'

    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details


The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License
  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program


You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ""copyright disclaimer"" for the program, if
necessary
  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc
, hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker


  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs
  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library
  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License

Trello,"
Trello is adopting Atlassian's Cloud Terms of Service
 This summary isn't intended to capture everything that changed, so please be sure to review the Cloud Terms of Service in their entirety
  We've also prepared separate FAQs to help answer some questions about the changes
  Structure
  Our new cloud terms include the general terms, Trello-specific terms and Orders
  The general terms establish a common set of terms that govern each customer's use of Trello (and other Atlassian cloud offerings, where applicable)
  The Trello-specific terms address unique Trello features and practices and override any conflicting terms in the framework terms
  Orders contain plan-level details like pricing, user headcounts and similar transaction-level details
  Existing Policies
  Under our cloud terms, we reference key existing Trello documents, including our Operations and Security Guide and Usage Guides, to reflect our current practices and to help provide a common reference point for our users
  New Policies
  Trello will be subject to several Atlassian policies, such as the Acceptable Use Policy and Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations Policy, in an effort to streamline our practices across offerings
  We will retire our DMCA policy effective November 1, 2018
  Customers and End Users
  We differentiate between the customer (the contracting party or ""you"" in the contract) and End Users (those that our customer invites or otherwise permits to access Trello)
  A user may be an End User on certain teams, but a customer with respect to personal use
  Identifying the Customer for Paid Plans
  If a user creates a paid team (or serves as an administrator for one) while listing an email address controlled by an employer or other entity as that user's primary or sole email address, the entity that controls the user's email address is the customer for that team
 User Notice for End Users
  Our customers are parties to the Cloud Terms of Service with us
  However, to help ensure End Users have sufficient notice of their responsibilities, our cloud terms include a User Notice
  The User Notice applies to End Users and is a streamlined set of terms that incorporates the Acceptable Use Policy and Privacy Policy
  The User Notice also notifies End Users about administrators' rights and how businesses can assert control over their business domains, consistent with our Privacy Policy
 Administrator Controls
  Administrators have important rights with respect to their teams
  Our new terms include information on the choices that administrators can take to manage their users
  Scope of Use
  Under our cloud terms, customers can generally use Trello for their own business purposes and personal use, subject to the usage restrictions (for example, prohibitions on reselling) and the other conditions
 Usage Limitations
  As noted above, use of Trello will now be subject to the Atlassian Acceptable Use Policy
  Our new terms otherwise adopt a common set of standard usage restrictions
   Third-Party Power-Ups
 Mutual Termination Rights
  We offer additional mutual rights to terminate the terms for cause
  In addition, customers are free to terminate at any time (and we offer a refund for customers' first 30 days on Trello, consistent with the other Atlassian cloud offerings)
  Effect of Termination
 Our new terms specify that customers should export their content prior to expiration, and otherwise include information on the effects of termination
  Reciprocal Confidentiality Obligations
  Our cloud terms include mutual confidentiality obligations
  Security
  Our new terms include a security section to help consolidate relevant security terms in one place
  We have also added a warranty concerning anti-virus protections
Atlassian Data Processing Addendum
 We will be offering a joint Data Processing Addendum (DPA) that covers Trello and the other Atlassian cloud offerings to help our customers meet their onward transfer requirements under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
  This new joint DPA will be offered in place of our current DPA beginning on November 1, 2018
 Trello IP Indemnification
  Our cloud terms include a new indemnification obligation for certain intellectual property claims by us for qualifying customers of paid plans
  Mutual Limitations of Liability
  We now offer mutual limitations of liability
  Our standard liability cap for customers generally tracks the prior 12 months' fees paid by such customers for Trello
 Listing Our Customers
  We may list customers in promotional materials consistent with Atlassian's practices
  If you do not wish to be listed, please email us at nomarketing@trello
com
Partner Sales
  Our new terms include terms that cover purchases through solution partners
Government Amendment
  Under our new terms, Atlassian's updated government amendment applies to government customers
  We will retire our existing government amendment effective November 1, 2018
  Future Changes to Terms
  Our cloud terms put more structure around future changes to the terms
  In particular, customers with paid plans have new protections if terms change
Governing Law
  We're going to California!  To streamline our practices across Trello and the other Atlassian cloud offerings, our new terms are subject to California law

 The arbitration requirement of this Section 11 is subject to the following exceptions:11

 Vendor does not agree to bear any other costs
 If your claim is more than US$75,000, the Consumer Procedures will govern payment

 Except as provided in below, the AAA’s Consumer Procedures will be applied to any Dispute between the parties

 Please watch the explainer video and read the terms below to learn about the clarifications we have made to more clearly describe how we are treating and protecting your data
 Over the next several weeks we will roll these terms out to customers globally
Published June 18, 2024
 Effective as of June 18, 2024
 These General Terms of Use replace and supersede all prior versions
Our General Terms of Use is a legal agreement between you and Adobe
 We know this language can seem complex, so as you’re reading through our terms, we are providing summaries as a helpful overview of what you’re agreeing to
 Only the terms themselves are legally binding, not these summaries
 In any business relationship, you agree to a set of terms
 These terms are our agreement with you for the use of Adobe products
 These General Terms of Use (“General Terms”), along with any applicable Product Specific Terms (see section 1
2 (Product Specific Terms) below) (collectively, the “Terms”) govern your use of and access to our websites, web-based applications and products, customer support, discussion forums or other interactive areas or services, and services such as Creative Cloud (collectively, the “Services”) and your installation and use of any software that we include as part of the Services, including, without limitation, mobile and desktop applications, Sample Files and Content Files (defined below), scripts, instruction sets, and related documentation (collectively, the “Software”)
 If you have agreed to the Subscription and Cancellation Terms (https://www
adobe
com/legal/subscription-terms
html), then such terms are also considered part of the Terms
 If you are using and accessing the Services and Software through Adobe’s Value Incentive Plan (“VIP”) program, then the Subscription and Cancellation Terms do not apply to you, but the remainder of the Terms will govern your use of and access to the Services and Software
 If you have entered into another agreement with us concerning specific Services and Software, then the terms of that agreement control where it conflicts with the Terms
 By using the services or the software, you affirm that you are of legal age to enter into the terms, or, if you are not, that you have obtained parental or guardian consent to enter into the terms

) The country and law(s) that this agreement falls under depends on where you live
 If you reside in North America (inclusive of the United States, Canada, Mexico, United States territories and possessions, and United States military bases, wherever located), your relationship is with Adobe Inc
, a United States company, and the Terms are governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, U
S
A
, unless preempted by U
S
 federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules
 If you reside outside of North America, your relationship is with Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, and the Terms are governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of Ireland, unless preempted by local law
 For customers in Australia, Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited is acting as an authorized agent of Adobe Systems Pty Ltd
 and is entering into this contract in its capacity as agent for Adobe Systems Pty Ltd
 You may have additional rights under your local law
 We do not seek to limit those rights where it is prohibited to do so by law
 For purposes of the Terms, “Adobe,” “us,” “we,” and “our” mean either Adobe Inc
, Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, or Adobe Systems Pty Ltd
, as applicable
These are general terms of use that apply to all of Adobe’s products
 However, there may also be terms that are specific to the products you use
 Product-specific terms always override the general terms
 Our Services and Software are licensed, not sold, to you, and also may be subject to one or more of the additional terms below (“Product Specific Terms”)
 If there is any conflict between the terms in the General Terms and the Product Specific Terms, then the Product Specific Terms govern in relation to those Services or Software
 The Product Specific Terms are subject to change as described in section 1
5 (Updates to Terms) below
 Product Specific Terms may also be referred to as Additional Terms
  If you’re using an individual Adobe plan, you have control over your content and the work you create
  If you’re using a business plan, your organization has access to and control over your work
 If you received an “Entitlement” (which is defined as the right to use, access, and consume the Services and Software) from an organization or group, including but not limited to a business or any other commercial entity, government entity, non-profit organization, or educational institution (each, a “Business”) under one of Adobe’s business plans (such as Creative Cloud for Teams, Creative Cloud for Enterprise, or Document Cloud), then (A) you are a “Business User” of such Business; (B) your Adobe profile associated with such Entitlement is a “Business Profile”; and (C) all references to “you” in the Terms will mean such Business and its Business Users, as applicable
 If you are a Business User, you agree that, due to your receipt of Entitlements from such Business, (1) Adobe may provide such Business with the ability to access, use, remove, retain, and control your Business Profile and all Content therein whether uploaded or imported before or after the date the Terms were last updated; (2) your use of the Services and Software is governed by such Business’s agreement with Adobe; and (3) Adobe may provide your personal information to such Business
 Access to complimentary Entitlements (“Complimentary Services”) may be provided to any users added to a Business’s Admin Console (as defined in the Business Customers Additional Terms set forth in Section 1
2), and such users would be considered Business Users
 If you are a Business User with Entitlements from multiple Businesses, you may have separate Business Profiles associated with each Business
 As a Business User, you may have different agreements with or obligations to a Business, which may affect your Business Profile or your Content (defined in 4
1)
 Adobe is not responsible for any violation by you of such agreements or obligations
 If you did not receive Entitlements from a Business (e
g
, you subscribed to a Creative Cloud for individuals plan and received Entitlements through this plan), then (a) you are a “Personal User”; (b) your Adobe profile is a personal profile; (c) you maintain sole access and control over all Content in your personal account or personal profile (except as otherwise indicated in the Privacy Policy); and (d) all references to “you” in the Terms will mean you as an individual
 If you receive Entitlements through a personal plan and from a Business, then you are both a Personal User and a Business User
 You are a Personal User when you utilize the Entitlements you obtained through your personal plan, and you are a Business User when you utilize your Entitlements provided by a Business
As a Personal User or a Business User, you may create an Adobe account using an email address provided or assigned to you by a Business (such as your work email address)
 If the Business establishes a direct relationship with us, they may want to add your account to such relationship
 If this happens, the Business may, with prior notice from the Business or us, roll your account into the Business’s account
 This means the Business may (A) access the account; (B) take control over the account and any Content therein whether stored, uploaded, or imported before or after the date the Terms were last updated; and (C) recommend any non-Business Content associated with such account to be moved to a new account that utilizes an email address not associated with such Business
 You, as a Personal User with an Adobe account assigned to a Business or a Business User, also acknowledge that Adobe may provide your personal information to such Business (including, for clarity, sharing your information with an administrator of your Business), such as your name, email address and Entitlement information
 If you do not want a Business to access, use, remove, retain, or control an account or profile, then do not use a Business email address with that account
 Information regarding Content storage and access, and how you may change the email address associated with your account may be found here: https://adobe
com/go/business-storage-helpx
 Adobe may share information about the Business, such as name and email address of the administrator, to a Business User
 Sometimes change happens
 We’ll notify you when there are important changes to these terms or to your subscription
 We may make changes to the Terms from time to time ranging from cleaning up typos to changes in policy
 If we make any important changes, we will notify you
  Any such changes will not apply to any dispute between you and Adobe arising prior to the date on which we posted the revised Terms incorporating such changes, or when the Terms otherwise become effective
 Please review the Terms regularly
  If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using our Services and Software and, if applicable, cancel your subscription

No one but you owns your content, but we need access to your content as necessary to operate Adobe applications and services
 We limit our access to very specific purposes
  We review content that is on our servers to screen for certain types of illegal content (such as child sexual abuse material), or other abusive content or behavior (for example, patterns of activity that indicate spam or phishing)
 We start this process with an automated machine-driven review, but if our automated systems or another user flags an issue, a person may review the content to confirm if it is illegal or abusive
  A person may review your content on our servers in limited circumstances, such as upon your request, when you choose to let us use your content to improve our products or when your content is flagged or reported as illegal
 Here’s what we don't do: We don’t scan or review content that is stored locally on your device
 We also don’t train generative AI models on your or your customers’ content unless you’ve submitted the content to the Adobe Stock marketplace
 We respect your rights to your Content (defined in Section 4
1) and limit our access to your Content in the following ways: (A) Operational Use
 Our Services and Software will access your Local and Cloud Content to enable the normal running of the Services and Software, for example, allowing Photoshop to open your file so you can edit it

 Learn more about your right to opt out of us performing Content Analytics using your Content (adobe
com/go/contentanalysisfaq) and usage data (adobe
com/go/usagedatafaq)
 Insights from Content Analytics may be used to inform our marketing to you, subject to your opt-out and consent rights regarding our marketing
 (E) Public and Shared Cloud Content
 For Cloud Content on our Adobe Stock platform and other public-facing platforms like Behance and Lightroom communities, all Cloud Content is subject to review for intellectual property issues and safety issues (for example, violence and nudity)
(F) Generative AI
  We will not use your Local or Cloud Content to train generative AI models except for Content you choose to submit to the Adobe Stock marketplace, and this use is governed by the separate Adobe Stock Contributor Agreement
 (G) Human Review of Cloud Content
 For Cloud Content, human review may occur in limited circumstances: Your Local Content is never reviewed by us
 In some countries, the law requires that we put a data protection agreement in place with you if we handle Personal Data (as defined in the applicable agreement) for you as part of our Services and Software
 These agreements are the EU Data Processing Agreement or Data Protection Terms, found in the following locations: (A) European Union (“EU”) Data Processing Agreement (or “DPA”)

 They are governed by the terms of the third-party providers
 Adobe may make third-party software and services (including plug-ins and extensions) available to you through the Services and Software as a convenience
 Third-party software and services are not Services and Software as defined in the Terms and your acquisition and use of such third-party software and services is solely between you and the third party
 Some third-party terms that may be applicable to your use of the Services and Software are available here: (https://www
adobe
com/go/thirdparty and https://www
adobe
com/legal/permissions/image-notice
html)
 You are responsible for complying with all applicable third-party terms
Your content is your content — you own it, and we don’t
“Content” means any text, information, communication, or material, such as audio files, video files, electronic documents, or images, that you upload, import into, embed for use by, or create using the Services and Software
  As between you and Adobe, you (as a Business User or a Personal User, as applicable) retain all rights and ownership of your Content
  You own your content
 But in order to use our products and services, we need you to give us permission to use your content when stored or processed in our cloud
 This permission is called a license
   This license allows us to provide our products and services to you, like if you want to share your content or publish your content on Behance
 Because it’s your content — not ours
 This license does not give us permission to train generative AI models with your or your customers’ content
 We don’t train generative AI models on your or your customers’ content unless you’ve submitted the content to the Adobe Stock marketplace
  We also ask whether you would like to help us improve our products and services, but it’s never required
 When you choose to help us improve our products, we need a limited license to your content for that specific purpose
  (A) License to Cloud Content to Operate the Services and Software on Your Behalf
 Solely for the purpose of operating the Services and Software on your behalf, and subject to section 4
2 (Ownership) above which states that in all cases you own your Content, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to do the following with your Cloud Content: We will not (and cannot) grant a sublicense to a third party that is greater than the rights you give us
  
Under this clause 4
3(A), we do not have the right to, and will not, use your Content to market or promote Adobe
  
We will not use these rights to train generative AI models on your Content and will not use the sublicense rights to have anyone else train generative AI models on your Content, except at your specific request (like you asking us to train a custom model on your Content)
 (B) License to Cloud Content to Improve our Services and Software
 (B) License to Cloud Content to Improve our Services and Software
 Solely for the purpose of our internal analysis of how you use our Services and Software and the characteristics of your Content (such as file type and structural attributes) (together, “Content Analytics”), you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to do the following to improve our Services and Software: We will not (and cannot) grant a sublicense to a third party that is greater than the rights you give us
  Under this clause 4
 (C) You May Choose Not to Participate in Content Analytics
(A) Sharing
  Some Services and Software may provide features that allow you to Share your Content with other users or to make it public
 “Share” means to email, post, transmit, stream, upload, or otherwise make available (whether to us or other users) through your use of the Services and Software
 Other users may use, copy, modify, or re-share your Content in many ways
 Please carefully consider what you choose to Share or make public as you are responsible for the Content that you Share
 (B) Level of Access
 We do not monitor or control what others do with your Content
 You are responsible for determining the limitations that are placed on your Content and for applying the appropriate level of access to your Content
 If you do not choose the access level to apply to your Content, the system may default to its most permissive setting

2 (Notice to Adobe)

 This Arbitration Agreement supersedes all prior versions
27

 LAWSUITS AND ARBITRATIONS HAVE BEEN FILED, OR MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD AFFECT YOU
 YOUR AGREEMENT TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT COULD AFFECT YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THOSE ACTIONS
27
2 Exceptions to Arbitration
27
3 Informal Dispute Resolution First
 We want to address any Disputes without needing arbitration
 If you have a Dispute with Zoom, prior to initiating arbitration, you agree to mail an individualized request (“Pre-Arbitration Demand”) to ATTN: Litigation Department, Zoom Video Communications, Inc
, 55 Almaden Blvd
, San Jose, CA 95113 so that we can work together to resolve the Dispute
 A Pre-Arbitration Demand brought on behalf of multiple individuals is invalid as to all
 The Pre-Arbitration Demand must include: (i) your name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address associated with your account; (ii) the name, telephone number, mailing address and email address of your counsel, if any; (iii) a description of your Dispute; and (iv) your signature
 Likewise, if Zoom has a Dispute with you, Zoom will send an email with its individualized Pre-Arbitration Demand, including the requirements listed above, to the email address associated with your Zoom account
 If you or Zoom have a Dispute involving claims under the exception to arbitration in Section 27
2(2), then this Section 27
3 does not apply to such Dispute
 You agree that compliance with this Section 27
3 is a condition precedent to commencing arbitration, and that the arbitrator shall dismiss any arbitration filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures
27
4 Arbitration Procedure
 If, after completing the informal dispute resolution process set out in Section 27
3, either you or Zoom wishes to initiate arbitration, the initiating party must serve the other party with a demand for arbitration
 Any demand for arbitration by you shall be sent to the Zoom Litigation Department address in Section 27
3
 Zoom will send any arbitration demand to the email address associated with your Zoom account or to your counsel, if any
The applicable arbitration provider depends on where you live
 (“ADR Services”) under its Arbitration Rules, available at https://www
adrservices
com/services-2/arbitration-rules
namadr
com/resources/rules-fees-forms
 This Agreement will govern to the extent it conflicts with the arbitration provider’s rules
 If the applicable arbitration provider is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider
 If the parties cannot agree on an appropriate alternative arbitration provider, then the parties will ask a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U
S
C
 § 5
 To the extent there is a dispute over which arbitration provider has jurisdiction, a NAM arbitrator shall be appointed to resolve that dispute
Arbitration hearings will take place through videoconferencing by default, unless you and Zoom agree upon another location in writing
 The arbitrator may award damages, declaratory or injunctive relief, and recoverable costs
 Any arbitration award may be enforced (such as through a judgment) in any court with jurisdiction
 An arbitration award shall have no preclusive effect in another arbitration or court proceeding involving Zoom and a different individual
 However, a court has exclusive authority to rule on the Mass Action Waiver in Section 27
6, including any claim that the section is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that it has been breached
If a request to proceed in small claims court (see Section 27
2(1)), is made after an arbitration has been initiated, but before an arbitrator has been appointed, such arbitration shall be administratively closed
 Any controversy over the small claims court’s jurisdiction shall be determined by the small claims court
 If you or Zoom challenges the small claims court election in your Dispute, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the small claims court election is unenforceable, then such election shall be severed from this Arbitration Agreement as to your Dispute
 However, such court determination shall have no preclusive effect in another arbitration or court proceeding involving Zoom and a different individual
27
5 Jury Trial Waiver
 You and Zoom hereby waive any constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury
 You and Zoom are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 27
2 above
 Court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review
 Discovery may be limited in arbitration, and procedures are more streamlined than in court
27
6 Mass Action Waiver
 You and Zoom agree that, except as specified in Section 27
7 below, each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not on a class, collective, representative, or mass action basis, and the parties hereby waive all rights to have any Dispute be brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated on a class, collective, representative, or mass action basis
 Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this Section 27
 This subsection does not prevent you or Zoom from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims
27
7 Bellwether Arbitrations
 Only those sixteen (16) arbitration demands shall be filed with the arbitration provider, and the parties shall hold in abeyance, and not file, the non-Bellwether Arbitrations
 Zoom will pay the arbitration provider’s costs for the sixteen (16) Bellwether Arbitrations
 The statutes of limitation, including the requirement to file within one (1) year in Section 27
10 below, shall remain tolled when non-Bellwether arbitration demands are held in abeyance
 If, contrary to this provision, a party prematurely files non-Bellwether Arbitrations with the arbitration provider, the parties agree that the arbitration provider shall hold those demands in abeyance
All parties agree that arbitration demands are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief
 Any party may request that the arbitration provider appoint a sole standing administrative arbitrator (“Administrative Arbitrator”) to determine threshold questions such as (i) whether the Bellwether Arbitration process is applicable or enforceable, (ii) whether particular demand(s) are part of a Mass Filing, and (iii) whether demands within a Mass Filing were filed in accordance with this Agreement, including Section 27
3
 In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree that the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly
 The Administrative Arbitrator’s costs shall be paid by Zoom
Following resolution of the Bellwether Arbitrations, the parties agree to engage in a global mediation of all remaining arbitration demands comprising the Mass Filing (“Global Mediation”)
 The Global Mediation shall be administered by the arbitration provider administering the Bellwether Arbitrations
 If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing within thirty (30) calendar days following the mediation, the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing shall be filed and administered by the arbitration provider on an individual basis pursuant to the arbitration provider’s rules, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise in writing
 Any party may request that the arbitration provider appoint an Administrative Arbitrator to determine threshold questions regarding the newly filed demands
 This Bellwether Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective, or mass action of any kind, or an arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision
 The statutes of limitation applicable to each arbitration demand within a Mass Filing, including the requirement to file within one (1) year in Section 27
10 below, shall remain tolled from the time a party makes a Pre-Arbitration Demand to the time when that party files the arbitration demand with the arbitration provider
27
8 Settlement Offers and Offers of Judgment
 If the offer is accepted, the offer with proof of acceptance shall be submitted to the arbitration provider, who shall enter judgment accordingly
 If an offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover their post-offer costs and shall pay the offering party’s costs from the time of the offer (which, solely for purposes of offers of judgment, may include reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent they are recoverable by statute, in an amount not to exceed the damages awarded)
 For arbitrations involving represented parties, the represented parties’ attorneys agree to communicate individual settlement offer(s) or offer(s) of judgment to each and every arbitration claimant or respondent to whom such offers are extended
27
9 Arbitration Costs
 Except as provided for in a Mass Filing (see Section 27
27
10 Requirement to File Within One Year
2(2)) must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be permanently barred
 The statute of limitations and any arbitration cost deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by Section 27
3 above
27
11 Opt-Out
 You may reject this Arbitration Agreement and opt out of arbitration by sending an email to opt-out@zoom
 Your opt-out notice must be individualized and must be sent from the email address associated with your individual Zoom account
 An opt-out notice that purports to opt out multiple parties will be invalid as to all such parties
 No individual (or their agent or representative) may effectuate an opt out on behalf of other individuals
 Your notice to opt-out must include your first and last name, address, the email address associated with your Zoom account, and an unequivocal statement that you decline this Arbitration Agreement
 If you do decide to opt out, that opt out will apply to this Arbitration Agreement and all previous versions thereof, and neither party will have the right to compel the other to arbitrate any Dispute
 However, all other parts of this Arbitration Agreement will continue to apply to you, and opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may enter into in the future with us
27
12 Severability
 Except as provided in Section 27
6 above, if any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then that provision will be severed; however, the remaining provisions shall still apply and shall be interpreted to achieve the closest possible intent to the original intent of this section, inclusive of the severed provision

Discord,"
Welcome! Discord is the best place to talk, hang out and have fun with friends online
 We’re happy you’re here
These terms set forth our legal obligations to each other
 They apply to your use of our services
‍IMPORTANT NOTE: The section titled “Settling Disputes Between You and Discord” contains an arbitration clause and class-action waiver that applies to all U
S
-based Discord users
 Please read this section carefully as it may significantly affect your legal rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court
When we say “Discord,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in these terms, we mean Discord Inc
, its subsidiaries, and its related companies
When we say “services” in these terms, we mean Discord’s services, apps, websites, and other products
When we say “you” or “your,” we mean you
 If you’re accessing our services on behalf of a legal entity (like your employer), you agree that you have the authority to bind that entity to these terms, and “you” and “your” will refer to that entity
We also have a Privacy Policy, Community Guidelines, and these other policies that apply to your use of our services and are incorporated into these terms
 You should read these policies—we’ve worked hard to make them simple and clear, and they contain important information about your use of our services
 If you use our API, Discord’s Developer Terms of Service and Developer Policy apply to that use
 Discord’s Paid Services Terms apply to any purchase you make through Discord, and Discord’s Monetization Terms apply to any sales you make through Discord
Together, these rules make Discord possible, and they matter to us
 If you believe others aren’t following them, please let us know by reporting it to us
We provide services that allow you to interact with other Discord users (such as through direct messages and group direct messages) and participate in large and small spaces (or “servers”)
 Our services may also include access to certain software, features, and content, including items that you can purchase from us or others
 Additional terms may apply to those purchases

 For more information on purchases, see “Discord’s Paid Services” below
Discord is the best place to talk, hang out and have fun with friends online
 To do that, we provide different digital spaces where you can connect with other Discord users and communities
 Discord users communicate primarily via “servers,” which are digital spaces made up of different types of channels
 Text channels allow users to interact via text-based messages, as well as images, GIFs, emoji, and other uploadable media
 Voice channels allow users to communicate by voice and/or streaming video
 Users can also communicate one-to-one using direct messages, or communicate with a limited number of users via group direct messages
 We’re always evolving our services, and we may create other types of spaces in the future!Users create servers, and users choose which servers to join and who their “friends” are
 All users must follow our Community Guidelines and other policies, but in Servers, the server owners and server admins control the server permissions and additional rules, including establishing membership requirements and creating custom roles and what those roles can do within the server
 Server owners and admins also control whether to make their server available in Server Discovery, whether to publish their server invite link on public websites, whether to enable community growth and safety features, and whether to add bots or other apps
Discord is designed to make communicating with the people you want to speak to as easy as possible
 Posts appear in text channels in the order in which they’re made
 Voice and video communication happens in real time
 We may build features that help you create content and communicate with others, join conversations more easily, or may highlight content and activity available to you on Discord that might be of interest
 Discord was also designed to make it easy to share what you’re up to
 You can stream what you’re doing on your device, or you can share your status, including what game you're playing, what song you’re listening to (if you link a music account), and more
 Sharing gameplay is fundamental to the Discord experience, so it’s turned on by default
 You can turn it off in your Settings at any time, and you’re in control of whether or not you connect other accounts to Discord
Discord’s services may be personalized to each user based on their activity, so that you can see content and communities that may be of interest to you
 You can control whether and to what extent Discord personalizes your experience in your Settings
 We’re actively developing new features and products to improve Discord
 As part of these efforts, we may add or remove features, start offering new services, or stop offering some services entirely (or just in some places or for some users) if they no longer make sense from a business perspective or create risk for Discord, our users, or other third parties
 We are not liable for any such outages or service changes
To access the services on an ongoing basis, you will need to create a Discord account
 You can provide a username and password, and a way of contacting you (such as an email address and/or phone number)
 You’ll also need to provide your birthday
 You are responsible for the security of your account, and you agree to notify us immediately if you believe your account has been compromised
 If you use a password, it must be strong, and we (strongly) recommend that you use that password only for your Discord account and that you enable two-factor authentication
 We may assume that any communications we’ve received from your account or the associated contact information have been made by you, and that any purchases made using your account were made by you
 If you get locked out of your account, we’ll need to contact you at the email or phone number associated with your account
 If your account is compromised or you no longer have access to your email account or phone number, we may not be able to restore your access to your account or the servers you’ve created
 You agree not to license, sell, lend, or transfer your account, Discord username, vanity URL, or other unique identifier without our prior written approval
 We also reserve the right to delete, change, or reclaim your username, URL, or other identifier
When we say “your content” in these terms, we mean all the things you add (upload, post, share, stream, etc
) to our services
 This includes text, links, GIFs, emoji, photos, videos, documents, or other media
 If we come up with another way for you to add content to the services, it includes that too
You don’t have any obligation to add content to the services
 If you choose to add content to the services, you are responsible for ensuring that you have the right to do so, that you have the right to grant the licenses in this section of these terms, and that your content is lawful
Our services allow users to add content in a number of different ways, including via direct messages, group direct messages, and in small and large servers
 For example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join
 Other server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites
 Anyone can access these spaces
 You should be aware that these permissions are set by server owners or admins, and they may change over time
 Please understand where you are posting on Discord, familiarize yourself with the relevant server permissions when joining and posting in a certain space, and choose the right space, features, and settings for you and your content
 Your content is yours, but you give us a license to it when you use Discord
 Your content may be protected by certain intellectual property rights
 We don’t own those
 But by using our services, you grant us a license—which is a form of permission—to do the following with your content, in accordance with applicable legal requirements, in connection with operating, developing, and improving our services:This license is worldwide, non-exclusive (which means you can still license your content to others), royalty-free (which means there are no fees for this license), transferable, and perpetual
We reserve the right to block, remove, and/or permanently delete your content if it is in breach of these terms, our Community Guidelines, our other policies, or any applicable law or regulation, or if it creates risk for Discord or negatively impacts the experience or interests of other Discord users to continue to make it available

 We retain all intellectual property rights in our content
 Other people’s content
 Our services might also provide you with access to other people’s content
 You may not use this content without that person’s consent, or as allowed by law
 Other people’s content is theirs and doesn’t necessarily reflect Discord’s own views
 Discord doesn’t endorse or verify the accuracy or reliability of content shared by Discord users
 We work hard to try to make Discord a safe, positive, and inclusive place, but cannot always prevent you from encountering content that you may find objectionable or offensive
 You may report content that you think violates any of our policies
 We have the right, but not the obligation, to review such reports and block or remove content at our discretion

 It’s your choice whether to use these third-party services and whether to participate in Discord servers that incorporate them
 You should review any terms and policies provided by the third parties before doing so as they govern your use of their services
 While these third parties do need to follow all policies that apply to them (which may include these Terms, our Community Guidelines, Developer Terms of Service, and Developer Policy), Discord is not responsible for any third-party services
We respect the intellectual property of others and expect our users to do the same
 See our Copyright & IP Policy for information on how to file a copyright complaint
We won’t charge you a fee to use the basic functionality of our services, but you may be able to pay for additional features and products

 If you reside in the European Economic Area, your appeal must be submitted within six months of the relevant decision
If you are using the services on behalf of a business or legal entity and not in an individual capacity, then you will indemnify and hold Discord and its officers, directors, employees and agents harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, and costs (including reasonable legal and accounting fees) related to (a) your access to or use of our services, (b) your content, or (c) your violation of these terms
We work hard to offer great services, but there are certain aspects that we can’t guarantee

Informal resolution
  Most disputes can be resolved informally, so if you have an issue with the services, you agree to reach out to us before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration
 This requires emailing disputes@discordapp
com a written notice (“Written Notice”), which must include: (1) your name; (2) the email address or phone number associated with your Discord account; (3) a detailed description of the issue; and (4) how you’d like to resolve it
  If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Written Notice, you and Discord agree to resolve any remaining dispute through further informal discussions or one of the formal dispute resolution provisions below
  You must engage in this informal resolution process before starting any formal dispute resolution unless exempted by law
 Applicable statutes of limitations and due dates for arbitration filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled upon receipt of the Written Notice to disputes@discordapp
com, while the parties attempt informal resolution
If you reside in the European Union, you may also be entitled to submit your complaint to the European Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Platform or the Out-of-Court Dispute Settlement (“OCDS”) mechanism under DSA Article 21
 ODR allows EU consumers to resolve disputes related to the online purchases of goods and services without going to court
  Note that a submission to the ODR or via the OCDS mechanism alone, without submitting a Written Notice to disputes@discordapp
com, will not toll the applicable statutes of limitations or other deadlines
Governing law and jurisdiction
If you are a consumer residing in the European Union, this clause and these terms in general do not affect any mandatory consumer rights you may have under your local law, and all disputes arising in connection with the services and/or these terms shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of Amsterdam, the Netherlands or, if you are a consumer, to a court closer to your domicile if in an EU Member State
‍IF YOU’RE A U
S
 RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS
  PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT:You and Discord agree that the U
S
 Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions
 Except for the circumstances described below, and only after the parties have engaged in a good-faith, but unsuccessful, effort to resolve the dispute in accordance with the “informal resolution” process (above), you and Discord agree to resolve any dispute, disagreement, or claim relating to these terms or our services through final and binding arbitration in the U
S
 county where you reside
  This includes claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this arbitration agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this arbitration agreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions set forth in section
 ‍Arbitration rules
 The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by these terms and the American Arbitration Association Rules, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions (the “AAA Rules”), available at https://www
adr
org/active-rules
 These terms will govern if there’s a conflict between these terms and the AAA Rules
  To begin the arbitration proceeding, either party must submit a written Demand for Arbitration (available at www
adr
org) with the AAA and provide a copy to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules
  To provide notice to Discord, please send an email with the subject line “Arbitration Demand” to disputes@discordapp
com
If the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000, and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Discord submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary
 If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which may be in-person, videoconference, or telephone conference
 ‍Arbitration costs
 AAA sets forth fees for its services, which are available at www
adr
org/sites/default/files/Consumer-Fee_Schedule
pdf
 If Discord is the party initiating an arbitration against you, Discord will pay all costs associated with the arbitration, including the entire filing fee
 If you initiate an arbitration against Discord, you will be responsible for the first $100 toward the nonrefundable Initial Filing Fee, unless the arbitrator determines that you are unable to pay, in which case Discord will pay the entire filing fee
 For cases seeking less than $75K, Discord will pay the remainder of the Initial Filing Fee and both parties’ Administrative fees (unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11)
  For cases seeking more than $75K, fees and costs will be determined in accordance with AAA Rules
 In all arbitrations, unless otherwise required by law or the AAA Rules, you’re responsible for all other additional arbitration costs incurred, including attorney’s fees and expert witness costs
 The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by AAA does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Section while such challenge remains pending before AAA, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction
Offer of Judgment
 If the offer made by the offering party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party will not recover its post-offer costs and will pay the offering party’s costs from the time of the offer
Arbitration Decision
 The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding on you and Discord, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction
 The arbitrator must follow these terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court
  Mass filings
 If, at any time, 30 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against Discord or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities (“Mass Filing”), these additional rules will apply:If you or your counsel file a demand for arbitration that fits within the definition of Mass Filing, you agree that your demand for arbitration will be subject to the additional protocols set forth in this mass filing subsection
Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators when there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or related parties
 The Parties agree to decide on a single arbitrator for all Initial Test Cases and to consolidate the cases for pre-hearing procedures and the pre-hearing conference
 Unless the claims are resolved in advance or the schedule is extended, the arbitrator will render final awards for the Initial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference
 If fewer than 5 Initial Test Cases resolve without a final decision of the arbitrator because they are resolved in advance, cases will be selected in batches of 10 and will proceed to arbitration until at least 5 have been resolved by a final arbitrator decision
 The arbitrator’s decisions for the Initial Test Cases shall be in writing and shall contain the essential findings and conclusions of fact and law upon which the arbitrator based the decision
  The results of the Initial Test Cases resolved by a final arbitrator decision will then be given to a mediator who will try to facilitate a resolution of the remaining cases
 After the results are provided to the mediator, the mediator and the parties will have 90 days (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on a resolution or substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding cases
 If the parties are unable to resolve the outstanding claims during the Mediation Period, either Party may choose to opt out of the arbitration process and proceed in court with its remaining claims
 Notice of the opt-out will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Mediation Period
  Opt out of arbitration under this section shall not be construed as opt out of the section titled “Class Waiver” below
 Absent notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to claims in the Mass Filing
  If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, any statute of limitations applicable to your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled
‍Other remedies
 ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL
 In some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court
 YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND DISCORD ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW
 You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state’s law
  ‍Opt-out
 You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing an opt-out notice to arbitration-opt-out@discord
com within 30 days of April 15, 2024 or when you first register your Discord account, whichever is later; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs
 If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Discord also will not be bound by them
‍Exceptions
 You or Discord may still pursue claims, if they qualify, exclusively in small claims court in San Francisco County, California, and you and Discord both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in that court
 The small claims court, and not any arbitrator or AAA, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve disputes regarding whether a dispute is properly within the jurisdiction of a small claims court
 Additionally, disputes concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of our services will not be subject to arbitration
 Either party may also seek a declaratory judgment or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party’s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court
 Seeking such relief shall not waive a party’s right to arbitration under this agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed (and any applicable statute of limitations tolled) pending the outcome of such action
Class waiver
 IF YOU’RE A U
S
 RESIDENT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED HEREIN, YOU AND DISCORD AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, UNLESS DISCORD PROVIDES ITS CONSENT TO CONSOLIDATE IN WRITING
 If this specific paragraph is found unenforceable, then the “Agreement to arbitrate” section will be null and void
 If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular remedy, then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be sought in court
  This subsection does not prevent you or Discord from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims
Changes to this Dispute Section: Discord will provide 30 days’ notice of the date of any material changes to this clause
 Changes will become effective on the 30th day and apply to all claims not yet filed
 If you continue to use the site after the 30th day, you agree that any unfiled claims of which Discord does not have actual notice are subject to the revised clause
 If Discord changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted this agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Discord product(s) or services 30 days after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes
 If you do not agree to such change, you may opt out by providing notice as described in this section
You have certain rights that, by law, can’t be limited by these terms, and we in no way intend to restrict those rights in these terms
Entire agreement
 These terms cover the entire agreement between you and Discord for your use of our services
Additional terms
 Where additional terms apply to our products or services, the additional terms will control with respect to your use of that product or service to the extent of any conflict with these terms

 These Products are provided to you by Meta Platforms, Inc

 Instead, businesses and organizations, and other persons pay us to show you ads for their products and services
 By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think may be relevant to you and your interests
 We use your personal data to help determine which personalized ads to show you


We don’t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don’t share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission
 Instead, advertisers can tell us things like the kind of audience they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested
 We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content
 See Section 2 below to learn more about how personalized advertising under these terms works on the Meta Products


Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads you see and provide all of the other services described below

 The services we provide
Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together
 For example, we use data about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to personalize your experience

Connect you with people and organizations you care about:
We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, and others that matter to you across the Meta Products you use
 We use data to make suggestions for you and others - for example, groups to join, events to attend, Facebook Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to become friends with
 Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups, and organizations they care about

Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:
There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook to communicate with friends, family, and others about what matters to you - for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across the Meta Products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile as well as showing you insights on how others engage with your content
 We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Meta Products

Help you discover content, products, and services that may interest you:
We show you personalized ads, offers, and other sponsored or commercial content to help you discover content, products, and services that are offered by the many businesses and organizations that use Facebook and other Meta Products
 Section 2 below explains this in more detail

Promote the safety, security, and integrity of our services, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:
People will only build community on Meta Products if they feel safe and secure
 We work hard to maintain the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality) of our Products and services
 We employ dedicated teams around the world, work with external service providers, partners and other relevant entities and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others, and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community, including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content
 If we learn of content or conduct like this, we may take appropriate action based on our assessment that may include - notifying you, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account, or contacting law enforcement
 We share data across Meta Companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products or to help keep Meta Products, users and the community safe
 For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law
 Meta may access, preserve, use and share any information it collects about you where it has a good faith belief it is required or permitted by law to do so
 For more information, please review our Privacy Policy

We use and develop advanced technologies - such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems, and augmented reality - so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location
 For example, technology like this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Facebook or Instagram
 We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the internet in areas with limited access
 And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products

Research ways to make our services better:
We engage in research to develop, test, and improve our Products
 This includes analyzing data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features
 Our Privacy Policy explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services

Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Meta Company Products:
Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, and others that are important to you
 We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different Meta Company Products that you use
 For example, we use data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with a business you follow on Facebook through Messenger

Ensuring access to our services:
To operate our global services and enable you to connect with people around the world, we need to transfer, store and distribute content and data to our data centers, partners, service providers, vendors and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence
 The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our services
 This infrastructure may be owned, operated, or controlled by Meta Platforms, Inc
, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, or its affiliates

Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our personalized ads system
 This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are
 We don't sell your personal data
 We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal, and the kind of audience they want to see their ads (for example, people between the age of 18-35 who like cycling)
 We then show their ad to people who we think might be interested

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Meta Products
 For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience, like the fact that women between the ages of 25 and 34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering have seen an ad
 We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission
 Learn more about how Meta ads work here

We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above to you
 You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our Privacy Policy
 You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you

 Your commitments to Facebook and our community
We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission
 In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:
1
 Who can use Facebook
When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable
 For this reason, you must:
Provide for your account the same name that you use in everyday life

Provide accurate information about yourself

Create only one account (your own) and use it for personal purposes

Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others, or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission)

We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Facebook if:
You are under 13 years old

You are a convicted sex offender

We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms or the Community Standards, or other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook
 If we disable your account for a violation of our Terms, the Community Standards, or other terms and policies, you agree not to create another account without our permission
 Receiving permission to create a new account is provided at our sole discretion, and does not mean or imply that the disciplinary action was wrong or without cause

You are prohibited from receiving our products, services, or software under applicable laws

2
 What you can share and do on Meta Products
We want people to use Meta Products to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community
 You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):
You may not use our Products to do or share anything:
That violates these Terms, the Community Standards, or other terms and policies that apply to your use of our Products

That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent (or assists someone else in using our Products in such a way)

That you do not own or have the necessary rights to share

That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing another’s copyright or trademark, or distributing or selling counterfeit or pirated goods), unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law

You may not upload viruses or malicious code, use the services to send spam, or do anything else that could disable, overburden, interfere with, or impair the proper working, integrity, operation, or appearance of our services, systemes, or Products

You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access

You may not proxy, request, or collect Product usernames or passwords, or misappropriate access tokens

You may not sell, license, or purchase any data obtained from us or our services, except as provided in the Platform Terms

You may not misuse any reporting, flagging, dispute, or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent, duplicative, or groundless reports or appeals

We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions
 We can also suspend or disable your account for conduct that violates these provisions, as provided in Section 4
B

If we remove content that you have shared in violation of the Community Standards, we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons
 For information on account suspension or termination, see Section 4
B below

To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies, if this feature exists in your jurisdiction

We also can remove or restrict access to content features, services, or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate misuse of our services or adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Meta

3
 The permissions you give us
We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:
Permission to use content you create and share: Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws

You retain ownership of the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Facebook and other Meta Company Products you use
 Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content
 You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want

However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a ""license"") to use this content
 This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above
 This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems

You can delete individual content you share, post, and upload at any time
 In addition, all content posted to your personal account will be deleted if you delete your account
 Learn more about how to delete your account
 Account deletion does not automatically delete content that you post as an admin of a page or content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos in Shared Albums which may continue to be visible to other album members

It may take up to 90 days to delete content after we begin the account deletion process or receive a content deletion request
 If you send content to trash, the deletion process will automatically begin in 30 days unless you chose to delete the content sooner
 While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users
 After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems

Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will continue to apply until that content is deleted);
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);
protect the safety, integrity, and security of our Products, systems, services, our employees, and users, and to defend ourselves;
comply with legal obligations for the preservation of evidence, including data Meta Companies providing financial products and services preserve to comply with any record keeping obligations required by law; or
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis)

In each of the above cases, this license will continue until the content has been fully deleted

Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about your actions with ads and sponsored or commercial content: You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection with ads, offers, and other sponsored or commercial content that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you
 Ads and content like this can be seen only by people who have your permission to see the actions you've taken on Meta Products
 You can learn more about your ad settings and preferences

Permission to update software you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available

4
 You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open source license) to modify, translate, create derivative works of, decompile, or reverse engineer our products or their components, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us, unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law or your conduct relates to the Meta Bug Bounty Program

 Additional provisions
1
 Updating our Terms
We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community
 As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on our Products and services, and/or to comply with applicable law
 Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect
 Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products

We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the Facebook community, you can delete your account at any time

2
 Account suspension or termination
We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas

If we determine, in our discretion, that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including in particular the Community Standards, we may suspend or permanently disable your access to Meta Company Products, and we may permanently disable or delete your account
 We may also disable or delete your account if you repeatedly infringe other people’s intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons

We may disable or delete your account if after registration your account is not confirmed, your account is unused and remains inactive for an extended period of time, or if we detect someone may have used it without your permission and we are unable to confirm your ownership of the account
 Learn more about how we disable and delete accounts

Where we take such action we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons

You can learn more about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think we have disabled your account by mistake

If you delete or we disable or delete your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will remain in place: 3, 4
2-4

 Limits on liability
We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them
 We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content)
 Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Meta Products will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months

4
 Disputes
We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us
 If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply

You and Meta each agree that any claim, cause of action, or dispute between us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or your access or use of the Meta Products shall be resolved exclusively in the U
S
 District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County
 You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, cause of action, or dispute without regard to conflict of law provisions
 Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, Meta may bring any claim, cause of action, or dispute we have against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim

5
 Other
These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc
 regarding your use of our Products
 They supersede any prior agreements

Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental terms
 If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you
 For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our Commercial Terms
 If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our Music Guidelines
 To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict

If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and if it can’t be made enforceable, then it will be severed and the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect
 If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver
 Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us

You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our consent

You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialized
 If you enable it in your settings, only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar legal document expressing clear consent to disclose your content to that person upon death or incapacity will be able to seek limited disclosure of information from your account after it is memorialized

These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights
 All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise

We may need to change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life)

We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services
 But we may use feedback and other suggestions without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential

We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you

Terms of Service


Meta builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, build communities, and grow businesses
 These Terms govern your use of Facebook, Messenger, and the other products, features, apps, services, technologies, and software we offer (the Meta Products or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply
 These Products are provided to you by Meta Platforms, Inc


We don’t charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms, unless we state otherwise
 Instead, businesses and organizations, and other persons pay us to show you ads for their products and services
 By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think may be relevant to you and your interests
 We use your personal data to help determine which personalized ads to show you


We don’t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don’t share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission
 Instead, advertisers can tell us things like the kind of audience they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested
 We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content
 See Section 2 below to learn more about how personalized advertising under these terms works on the Meta Products


Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads you see and provide all of the other services described below
 You can also go to your settings pages of the relevant Meta Product at any time to review the privacy choices you have about how we use your data

 The services we provide
Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together
 For example, we use data about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to personalize your experience

Connect you with people and organizations you care about:
We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, and others that matter to you across the Meta Products you use
 We use data to make suggestions for you and others - for example, groups to join, events to attend, Facebook Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to become friends with
 Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups, and organizations they care about

Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:
There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook to communicate with friends, family, and others about what matters to you - for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across the Meta Products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile as well as showing you insights on how others engage with your content
 We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Meta Products

Help you discover content, products, and services that may interest you:
We show you personalized ads, offers, and other sponsored or commercial content to help you discover content, products, and services that are offered by the many businesses and organizations that use Facebook and other Meta Products
 Section 2 below explains this in more detail

Promote the safety, security, and integrity of our services, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:
People will only build community on Meta Products if they feel safe and secure
 We work hard to maintain the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality) of our Products and services
 We employ dedicated teams around the world, work with external service providers, partners and other relevant entities and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others, and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community, including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content
 If we learn of content or conduct like this, we may take appropriate action based on our assessment that may include - notifying you, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account, or contacting law enforcement
 We share data across Meta Companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products or to help keep Meta Products, users and the community safe
 For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law
 Meta may access, preserve, use and share any information it collects about you where it has a good faith belief it is required or permitted by law to do so
 For more information, please review our Privacy Policy


In some cases, the Oversight Board may review our decisions, subject to its terms and bylaws

Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:
We use and develop advanced technologies - such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems, and augmented reality - so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location

 We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the internet in areas with limited access
 And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products

Research ways to make our services better:
We engage in research to develop, test, and improve our Products
 This includes analyzing data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features

 Additional provisions
1
 Updating our Terms
We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community
 As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on our Products and services, and/or to comply with applicable law
 Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect
 Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products

We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the Facebook community, you can delete your account at any time

2
 Account suspension or termination
We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas

If we determine, in our discretion, that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including in particular the Community Standards, we may suspend or permanently disable your access to Meta Company Products, and we may permanently disable or delete your account
 We may also disable or delete your account if you repeatedly infringe other people’s intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons

We may disable or delete your account if after registration your account is not confirmed, your account is unused and remains inactive for an extended period of time, or if we detect someone may have used it without your permission and we are unable to confirm your ownership of the account
 Learn more about how we disable and delete accounts

Where we take such action we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons

You can learn more about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think we have disabled your account by mistake

If you delete or we disable or delete your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will remain in place: 3, 4

 Limits on liability
We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them
 We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content)
 Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Meta Products will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months

4
 Disputes
We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us
 If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply

You and Meta each agree that any claim, cause of action, or dispute between us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or your access or use of the Meta Products shall be resolved exclusively in the U
S
 District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County
 You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, cause of action, or dispute without regard to conflict of law provisions
 Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, Meta may bring any claim, cause of action, or dispute we have against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim

5
 Other
These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc
 regarding your use of our Products
 They supersede any prior agreements

Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental terms
 If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you
 For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our Commercial Terms
 If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our Music Guidelines
 To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict

If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and if it can’t be made enforceable, then it will be severed and the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect
 If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver
 Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us

You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our consent

You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialized
 If you enable it in your settings, only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar legal document expressing clear consent to disclose your content to that person upon death or incapacity will be able to seek limited disclosure of information from your account after it is memorialized

These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights
 All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise

We may need to change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life)

We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services
 But we may use feedback and other suggestions without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential

We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you

 You may not use as a username any name that is offensive, vulgar or obscene

4
 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User
