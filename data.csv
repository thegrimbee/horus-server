,0
“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users,0
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below,0

 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page,0
 ,0
"Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator",0
" Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content",0

,0
“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users,0
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below,0

 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page,0
 ,0
"Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator",0
" Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content",0

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users,0
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below,0

"Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator",0
