ARBITRATION PROCEDURE AND GOVERNING LAW

Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome",0
"

"
 A Notice of Dispute from you to Rec Room must be emailed to legal@recroom",0
"
com (“Notice Address”)",0

 Any Notice of Dispute must include (i) the claimant’s full legal name, complete mailing address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) any relevant facts regarding claimant’s use of the Services or Content; and (iv) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice",0

If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Rec Room Inc submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary",0
"
 If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable)",0
"
 Any arbitration hearing will be conducted remotely by telephone or video conference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines, or the parties agree, that a hearing should be conducted in person, the arbitration hearing will take place as close to your residence as practicable, or another agreed upon locale",0
"
 Subject to the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable), the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration",0
"
 The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award",0

 The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the ""Limitation of Liability"" section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable",0
"


Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable)",0
"


Confidentiality: The parties agree that the arbitrator is authorized to issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law",0

ARBITRATION PROCEDURE AND GOVERNING LAW

Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome",0
"

"
 A Notice of Dispute from you to Rec Room must be emailed to legal@recroom",0

"
 If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable)",0
"
 Any arbitration hearing will be conducted remotely by telephone or video conference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines, or the parties agree, that a hearing should be conducted in person, the arbitration hearing will take place as close to your residence as practicable, or another agreed upon locale",0
"
 Subject to the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable), the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration",0
"
 The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award",0
"

"


Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable)",0
"


Confidentiality: The parties agree that the arbitrator is authorized to issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law",0

"
 The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section",0

"


ARBITRATION PROCEDURE AND GOVERNING LAW

Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome",0

"
 A Notice of Dispute from you to Rec Room must be emailed to legal@recroom",0

"
 Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this subsection",0

"


If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Rec Room Inc submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary",0
"
 If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable)",0
"
 Any arbitration hearing will be conducted remotely by telephone or video conference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines, or the parties agree, that a hearing should be conducted in person, the arbitration hearing will take place as close to your residence as practicable, or another agreed upon locale",0
"
 Subject to the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable), the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration",0
"

"


Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable)",0
"


Confidentiality: The parties agree that the arbitrator is authorized to issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law",0
"
com within 30 days of the date of the posting of that change that provides (i) your full legal name, (ii) change(s) you are rejecting",0
"
 This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether",0
"
