ARBITRATION PROCEDURE AND GOVERNING LAW

"

"


Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable)",0
"


Confidentiality: The parties agree that the arbitrator is authorized to issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law",0

ARBITRATION PROCEDURE AND GOVERNING LAW

Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome",0
"
 Therefore, in the event of a Dispute, you and Rec Room each agree to send the other party a written Notice of Dispute (âNotice of Disputeâ or âNoticeâ)",0
"
 A Notice of Dispute from you to Rec Room must be emailed to legal@recroom",0

 Any Notice of Dispute must include (i) the claimantâs full legal name, complete mailing address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) any relevant facts regarding claimantâs use of the Services or Content; and (iv) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice",0
"
 The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other personâs dispute",0
"
 Rec Room will send any Notice of Dispute to you at the email address or mailing address it has for you, if any",0
"


After receipt of a Notice of Dispute, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement)",0

"

"
 The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the ""Limitation of Liability"" section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable",0
"


Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable)",0
"


Confidentiality: The parties agree that the arbitrator is authorized to issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law",0
