        Hi all - wondering if you can assist - are there any terms and conditions for Notepad++ looking for an indemnity clause?@Hollie-Kanesee license text file which is in the installation directory
Cheers
ClaudiaHi Claudia, thank you so much for your reply
 I am on https://notepad-plus-plus
org  and cannot locate the installation directory
 Can you tell me where about’s this is located - so sorry if I am blind as a bat!Holly,
Claudia was referring to the directory NPP gets installed to when you download and install it
 The license file is basically the text from the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 2, June 1991
I think the default directory for License (no file extension) is C:\Program Files\Notepad++
