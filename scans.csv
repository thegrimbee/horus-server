        Hi all - wondering if you can assist - are there any terms and conditions for Notepad++ looking for an indemnity clause?@Hollie-Kanesee license text file which is in the installation directory
Cheers
ClaudiaHi Claudia, thank you so much for your reply
 I am on https://notepad-plus-plus
org  and cannot locate the installation directory
 Can you tell me where about’s this is located - so sorry if I am blind as a bat!Holly,
Claudia was referring to the directory NPP gets installed to when you download and install it
 The license file is basically the text from the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 2, June 1991
I think the default directory for License (no file extension) is C:\Program Files\Notepad++

By issuing a chargeback or refund request for Premium subscriptions paid for through a third party, you agree to allow Telegram to release necessary data to that third party regarding your account status and Telegram Premium purchases

 Therefore, there is no guarantee that enabling Premium Services will always affect the speed with which you download documents and media on Telegram
In certain countries Telegram shows sponsored messages in one-to-many channels that have over 1000 subscribers
 The subscribers of Telegram Premium won't see such sponsored messages displayed by Telegram
 However, channels on Telegram are managed by other users, their administrators, who may publish their own content featuring third-party promotions or sponsorships
 These ads are not part of the Telegram advertisement platform and subscribers of Telegram Premium may still see them
Premium Services provide users with a number of “boosts” which they can assign to channels to contribute to increasing the level of these channels, with each level unlocking or extending certain features for the channel
A purchased Telegram Premium subscription provides 4 boosts
 Gifted subscriptions provide 1 boost to the gift recipient and 3 boosts to the gifter
 Telegram Premium subscriptions distributed via giveaways in channels do not provide boosts to the accounts that activate them and instead boost the channel which organized the giveaway
Channel admins can organize giveaways at their expense, purchasing a number of premium subscriptions to be distributed among present or future subscribers and immediately gain 4 boosts per purchased subscription
 The boosts received by the channel can’t be reassigned to another channel, they are activated the moment the giveaway is first launched and remain active for the purchased duration of the subscriptions distributed in the giveaway
Telegram selects winners based on the criteria that channel administrators choose when setting up the giveaway
 In the rare chance that a technical issue results in an unintended outcome, Telegram will attempt to rectify the situation but makes no guarantees to the organizers of a giveaway or its participants

 Sharing of your User login or password is prohibited
 You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account

You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity that is not lawfully available for use, or a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you, without appropriate authorization
 You may not use as a username any name that is offensive, vulgar or obscene

 By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are over the age of 13

 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Sharing of your User login or password is prohibited
 You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account

You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity that is not lawfully available for use, or a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you, without appropriate authorization

 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Sharing of your User login or password is prohibited
 You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account

 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Sharing of your User login or password is prohibited
 You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account

 By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are over the age of 13

4
 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Sharing of your User login or password is prohibited
 You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account

You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity that is not lawfully available for use, or a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you, without appropriate authorization

4
 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Sharing of your User login or password is prohibited
 You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account

 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Sharing of your User login or password is prohibited
 You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account

 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 You also represent and warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made available through the Service, nor any use of your User Content by Notion on or through the Service will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation or violate any agreement you have with any third party

 By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are over the age of 13

4
 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User
