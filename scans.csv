        Hi all - wondering if you can assist - are there any terms and conditions for Notepad++ looking for an indemnity clause?@Hollie-Kanesee license text file which is in the installation directory
Cheers
ClaudiaHi Claudia, thank you so much for your reply
 I am on https://notepad-plus-plus
org  and cannot locate the installation directory
 Can you tell me where about’s this is located - so sorry if I am blind as a bat!Holly,
Claudia was referring to the directory NPP gets installed to when you download and install it
 The license file is basically the text from the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 2, June 1991
I think the default directory for License (no file extension) is C:\Program Files\Notepad++

By issuing a chargeback or refund request for Premium subscriptions paid for through a third party, you agree to allow Telegram to release necessary data to that third party regarding your account status and Telegram Premium purchases

 Therefore, there is no guarantee that enabling Premium Services will always affect the speed with which you download documents and media on Telegram
In certain countries Telegram shows sponsored messages in one-to-many channels that have over 1000 subscribers
 The subscribers of Telegram Premium won't see such sponsored messages displayed by Telegram
 However, channels on Telegram are managed by other users, their administrators, who may publish their own content featuring third-party promotions or sponsorships
 These ads are not part of the Telegram advertisement platform and subscribers of Telegram Premium may still see them
Premium Services provide users with a number of “boosts” which they can assign to channels to contribute to increasing the level of these channels, with each level unlocking or extending certain features for the channel
A purchased Telegram Premium subscription provides 4 boosts
 Gifted subscriptions provide 1 boost to the gift recipient and 3 boosts to the gifter
 Telegram Premium subscriptions distributed via giveaways in channels do not provide boosts to the accounts that activate them and instead boost the channel which organized the giveaway
Channel admins can organize giveaways at their expense, purchasing a number of premium subscriptions to be distributed among present or future subscribers and immediately gain 4 boosts per purchased subscription
 The boosts received by the channel can’t be reassigned to another channel, they are activated the moment the giveaway is first launched and remain active for the purchased duration of the subscriptions distributed in the giveaway
Telegram selects winners based on the criteria that channel administrators choose when setting up the giveaway
 In the rare chance that a technical issue results in an unintended outcome, Telegram will attempt to rectify the situation but makes no guarantees to the organizers of a giveaway or its participants

 Sharing of your User login or password is prohibited
 You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account

You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity that is not lawfully available for use, or a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you, without appropriate authorization
 You may not use as a username any name that is offensive, vulgar or obscene

 By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are over the age of 13

 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Sharing of your User login or password is prohibited
 You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account

You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity that is not lawfully available for use, or a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you, without appropriate authorization

 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Sharing of your User login or password is prohibited
 You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account

 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Sharing of your User login or password is prohibited
 You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account

 By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are over the age of 13

4
 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Sharing of your User login or password is prohibited
 You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account

You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity that is not lawfully available for use, or a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you, without appropriate authorization

4
 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Sharing of your User login or password is prohibited
 You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account

 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Sharing of your User login or password is prohibited
 You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account

 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 You also represent and warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made available through the Service, nor any use of your User Content by Notion on or through the Service will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation or violate any agreement you have with any third party

 By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are over the age of 13

4
 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 Workspaces
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces
”
There are two general types of Workspaces on the Service:
“Personal Workspaces” that can only be administered by the user that created the Workspace and, can only be accessed by such user and any permitted guest users, subject to below regarding Personal Workspaces created using an Organization Email

“Organizational Workspaces” that require an eligible Subscription and that can be accessed by multiple users
 Further details on Organizational Workspaces are outlined below
 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace
 Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another)
 You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page
 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their Notion account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator
 Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register for Notion with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, member, or guest, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content
 Such Organization may have the ability to manage your Workspace, including to claim control and ownership of any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator or remove you from any Workspace for which you are a member, including any Content within such Workspaces

If you join an Organizational Workspace, your use must comply with that Organization’s policies and any agreement that you may have with that Organization
 Organizational Workspaces are subject to such Organization’s control
 Organization administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove Content in or from the Organizational Workspace
 They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to the Organizational Workspace
 If you convert an existing Personal Workspace into an Organizational Workspace or transfer or share content with an Organizational Workspace, your administrator(s) may prevent you from later disassociating Content from the Organizational Workspace

5
 Interacting with Organizational Workspaces
An Organization may (i) invite you to use or permit you to use their Organizational Workspace; and/or (ii) invite you to join the Service as their Organization User

As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post Content to an Organizational Workspace (such Content, the “Organization Content”), then as between you, Notion, and such Organization, the Organization will own all rights to such Organization Content
 For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not prevent you from entering into a separate agreement between you and the Organization that addresses ownership of Content as between you and such Organization

Organizations are authorized to add and remove users from their Organizational Workspaces
 Users that have been authorized to use an Organizational Workspace of the Service by an Organization are referred to as an “Organization User” while they are using such Organization Workspace
 If you purchased an Organization Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Organization, and not you
 The Organization can modify and re-assign roles on the Organizational Workspace (including your role)
 If the Organization elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Organizational Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Organization to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Organization

If you are using an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes
 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Organizational Workspace as an Organization User

 They are phrased in a question and answer format and address common license questions; the Additional Terms and Limited Warranty follow and contain greater detail
 We also incorporate terms at links that are referenced in this agreement
 You should review the entire agreement because all of the terms are important and together create this contract that applies to you
 You should also review linked terms, once the software is running
 IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES, THE ADDITIONAL TERMS CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
THOSE AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE WITH MICROSOFT

 These rights will terminate when you uninstall the application from these licensed devices
 Except for the permitted use described under “Remote Access” below, this license is for direct use of the software only through the input mechanisms of the licensed devices such as a touchscreen
 It does not give permission for installation of the software on a server or for use by or through computers or devices connected to the server over an internal or external network
 The software also is not licensed for commercial hosting - so you may not make the software available over a network for simultaneous use by multiple users
 For more information on multiple user scenarios and virtualization, see the Additional Terms
What about upgrading the Software?    If you install the software covered by this agreement as an upgrade to your existing software, then the upgrade replaces the original software that you are upgrading
 You do not retain any rights to the original software after you have upgraded and you may not continue to use it or transfer it in any way
 This agreement governs your rights to use the upgrade software and replaces the agreement for the software from which you upgraded
Can I transfer the Software to another device or user?    The license includes the right to install and use the software on up to fifteen (15) licensed devices (or such number of devices as may otherwise be provided for in the Microsoft Store Terms of Use) simultaneously
 If you attempt to install the software on more devices, it may be deactivated automatically from one of these devices, so that no more than the maximum number of instances are activated at any one time
Are there any limitations on the number of notes I can create, access or edit with OneNote?    There are no specific restrictions on the number of notes you can create, access or edit
 However, you may be limited by the hardware restrictions of your device or storage restrictions on the server where your notes are stored

 You agree that we may use and disclose the information as described in our Privacy Statement, at Microsoft Privacy Statement
What does this agreement apply to?    This agreement applies to the software, and also any Microsoft updates, supplements, and services for the software, unless other terms come with them
 Other terms and conditions may apply to use of other services including the Microsoft Store Terms of Use
Are there things I’m not allowed to do with the Software?    Yes
 Because the software is licensed, not sold, Microsoft reserves all rights (such as rights under intellectual property laws) not expressly granted in this agreement

Resolving Disputes; Agreement to Arbitrate; Class Action & Jury Waiver

Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.
 It affects your legal rights.
 It provides for resolution of most disputes through individual arbitration instead of court trials and class actions.
 This section also contains a jury trial waiver and a waiver of any and all rights to proceed in class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted by the arbitral forum), private attorney general, or representative action in arbitration or litigation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.


AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE & CLASS ACTION/JURY WAIVER

You and Rec Room Inc agree that any dispute, claim or controversy between you and Rec Room, including but not limited to any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the Services or Content (collectively, ""Disputes""), whether such Disputes arose before, on, or subsequent to you entering these Terms, shall be exclusively resolved by individual, binding arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement.
 The arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms are unconscionable or illusory, in whole or in part, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.


Notwithstanding the foregoing and the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver below, each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction.
 In addition, (i) the parties each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (including anti-circumvention claims, or any other related statutory rights) (an ""IP Equity Action"") and (ii) Rec Room retains the right to bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction arising out of or relating to Your violation of the Prohibitions.
 You agree any disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or related to (i) and (ii) will be governed by Washington law and controlling United States federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions of any jurisdiction to the contrary, and any such disputes, claims, or controversies shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and you consent to venue in, the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington.


You acknowledge and agree that you and Rec Room are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted buy the arbitral forum), private attorney general, or representative proceeding.
 Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this ""Dispute Resolution"" section will survive any termination of these Terms.


To the extent that any claims are allowed to proceed on a class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted by the arbitral forum), or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction in Seattle, Washington, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Rec Room may participate in a class-wide settlement.


OPT OUT PROCEDURES

To opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, you must send us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”) by email at http://mailto:support@recroom.
com within 30 days from the date that you first accessed the Services or Content (“Opt-Out Period”).
 The Opt-Out Notice must contain your full legal name, your complete mailing and email address, a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, and your signature.
 If your Opt-Out Period has passed, you are not eligible to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.
 If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other provisions of the Terms will continue to apply to you.
 Additionally, if you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, you may still be bound to previous versions of this Arbitration Agreement by reason of your separate agreement to those previous versions.
 In other words, opting out of this Arbitration Agreement shall have no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements you may enter into with Rec Room.
 As stated above, if you do not opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within the Opt-Out Period, then you will be bound to the terms and conditions of this Arbitration Agreement which shall supersede and replace in its entirety all previous versions of Rec Room’s Arbitration Agreement.
 If you timely provide Rec Room with a valid Opt-Out Notice, all Disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and you consent to venue in, the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington.


ARBITRATION RULES

All Disputes shall be submitted to JAMS for arbitration before one arbitrator in accordance with the applicable JAMS clauses, rules, and procedures (the ""JAMS Rules"") or the JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) then in effect, except as modified by this ""Dispute Resolution"" section.
 The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.


If 75 or more similar Demands for Arbitration are presented by or with the assistance, coordination, or cooperation of the same law firm, group of law firms, cooperating law firms, or organization, JAMS’ Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines and Mass Arbitration Fee Schedule (the “JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules”) shall apply.


It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and the JAMS Rules and JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 If the FAA and the JAMS Rules and JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of Washington.


ARBITRATION PROCEDURE AND GOVERNING LAW

Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome.
 Therefore, in the event of a Dispute, you and Rec Room each agree to send the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice of Dispute” or “Notice”).
 A Notice of Dispute from you to Rec Room must be emailed to legal@recroom.
com (“Notice Address”).
 Any Notice of Dispute must include (i) the claimant’s full legal name, complete mailing address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) any relevant facts regarding claimant’s use of the Services or Content; and (iv) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice.
 The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person’s dispute.
 Rec Room will send any Notice of Dispute to you at the email address or mailing address it has for you, if any.


After receipt of a Notice of Dispute, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement).
 You and we agree that, after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, the recipient may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will attend (with counsel, if represented).


Compliance with this mandatory pre-arbitration Notice and informal dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration.
 Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this subsection.


Arbitration Location and Procedure: If the parties cannot resolve the Dispute through the above informal dispute resolution procedures, a party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).


If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Rec Room Inc submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
 If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).
 Any arbitration hearing will be conducted remotely by telephone or video conference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines, or the parties agree, that a hearing should be conducted in person, the arbitration hearing will take place as close to your residence as practicable, or another agreed upon locale.
 Subject to the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable), the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
 The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
 An arbitrator’s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.
 The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the ""Limitation of Liability"" section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.


Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).


Confidentiality: The parties agree that the arbitrator is authorized to issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law.
com within 30 days of the date of the posting of that change that provides (i) your full legal name, (ii) change(s) you are rejecting.
 This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether.


SEVERABILITY & SURVIVAL

If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement, or a portion thereof, is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible.
 The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein.


This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of these Terms.


General Terms

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to its conflict-of-laws provisions.
 These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Rec Room Inc and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Rec Room Inc and you regarding the Services and Content.
 If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the ""Arbitration"" section above or by court of competent jurisdiction), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
 You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Rec Room Inc's prior written consent.
 Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null.
 Rec Room Inc may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.
 Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
 Any notices or other communications provided by Rec Room Inc under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, may be given: (i) via email; (ii) by posting to the Services; or (iii) by certified mail.
 For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted and for notices made by posting to the Services, the date is the date of the posting.
 Rec Room Inc's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision.
 The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Rec Room Inc.
 Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.

Resolving Disputes; Agreement to Arbitrate; Class Action & Jury Waiver

Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.
 It affects your legal rights.
 It provides for resolution of most disputes through individual arbitration instead of court trials and class actions.
 This section also contains a jury trial waiver and a waiver of any and all rights to proceed in class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted by the arbitral forum), private attorney general, or representative action in arbitration or litigation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.


AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE & CLASS ACTION/JURY WAIVER

You and Rec Room Inc agree that any dispute, claim or controversy between you and Rec Room, including but not limited to any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the Services or Content (collectively, ""Disputes""), whether such Disputes arose before, on, or subsequent to you entering these Terms, shall be exclusively resolved by individual, binding arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement.
 The arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms are unconscionable or illusory, in whole or in part, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.


Notwithstanding the foregoing and the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver below, each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction.
 In addition, (i) the parties each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (including anti-circumvention claims, or any other related statutory rights) (an ""IP Equity Action"") and (ii) Rec Room retains the right to bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction arising out of or relating to Your violation of the Prohibitions.
 You agree any disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or related to (i) and (ii) will be governed by Washington law and controlling United States federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions of any jurisdiction to the contrary, and any such disputes, claims, or controversies shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and you consent to venue in, the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington.


You acknowledge and agree that you and Rec Room are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted buy the arbitral forum), private attorney general, or representative proceeding.
 Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this ""Dispute Resolution"" section will survive any termination of these Terms.


To the extent that any claims are allowed to proceed on a class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted by the arbitral forum), or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction in Seattle, Washington, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Rec Room may participate in a class-wide settlement.


OPT OUT PROCEDURES

To opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, you must send us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”) by email at http://mailto:support@recroom.
com within 30 days from the date that you first accessed the Services or Content (“Opt-Out Period”).
 The Opt-Out Notice must contain your full legal name, your complete mailing and email address, a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, and your signature.
 If your Opt-Out Period has passed, you are not eligible to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.
 If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other provisions of the Terms will continue to apply to you.
 Additionally, if you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, you may still be bound to previous versions of this Arbitration Agreement by reason of your separate agreement to those previous versions.
 In other words, opting out of this Arbitration Agreement shall have no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements you may enter into with Rec Room.
 As stated above, if you do not opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within the Opt-Out Period, then you will be bound to the terms and conditions of this Arbitration Agreement which shall supersede and replace in its entirety all previous versions of Rec Room’s Arbitration Agreement.
 If you timely provide Rec Room with a valid Opt-Out Notice, all Disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and you consent to venue in, the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington.


ARBITRATION RULES

All Disputes shall be submitted to JAMS for arbitration before one arbitrator in accordance with the applicable JAMS clauses, rules, and procedures (the ""JAMS Rules"") or the JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) then in effect, except as modified by this ""Dispute Resolution"" section.
 The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.


If 75 or more similar Demands for Arbitration are presented by or with the assistance, coordination, or cooperation of the same law firm, group of law firms, cooperating law firms, or organization, JAMS’ Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines and Mass Arbitration Fee Schedule (the “JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules”) shall apply.


It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and the JAMS Rules and JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 If the FAA and the JAMS Rules and JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of Washington.


ARBITRATION PROCEDURE AND GOVERNING LAW

Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome.
 Therefore, in the event of a Dispute, you and Rec Room each agree to send the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice of Dispute” or “Notice”).
 A Notice of Dispute from you to Rec Room must be emailed to legal@recroom.
com (“Notice Address”).
 Any Notice of Dispute must include (i) the claimant’s full legal name, complete mailing address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) any relevant facts regarding claimant’s use of the Services or Content; and (iv) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice.
 The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person’s dispute.
 Rec Room will send any Notice of Dispute to you at the email address or mailing address it has for you, if any.


After receipt of a Notice of Dispute, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement).
 You and we agree that, after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, the recipient may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will attend (with counsel, if represented).


Compliance with this mandatory pre-arbitration Notice and informal dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration.
 Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this subsection.


Arbitration Location and Procedure: If the parties cannot resolve the Dispute through the above informal dispute resolution procedures, a party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).


If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Rec Room Inc submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
 If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).
 Any arbitration hearing will be conducted remotely by telephone or video conference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines, or the parties agree, that a hearing should be conducted in person, the arbitration hearing will take place as close to your residence as practicable, or another agreed upon locale.
 Subject to the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable), the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
 The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
 An arbitrator’s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.
 The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the ""Limitation of Liability"" section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.


Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).


Confidentiality: The parties agree that the arbitrator is authorized to issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law.
com within 30 days of the date of the posting of that change that provides (i) your full legal name, (ii) change(s) you are rejecting.
 This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether.


SEVERABILITY & SURVIVAL

If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement, or a portion thereof, is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible.
 The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein.


This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of these Terms.


General Terms

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to its conflict-of-laws provisions.
 These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Rec Room Inc and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Rec Room Inc and you regarding the Services and Content.
 If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the ""Arbitration"" section above or by court of competent jurisdiction), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
 You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Rec Room Inc's prior written consent.
 Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null.
 Rec Room Inc may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.
 Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
 Any notices or other communications provided by Rec Room Inc under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, may be given: (i) via email; (ii) by posting to the Services; or (iii) by certified mail.
 For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted and for notices made by posting to the Services, the date is the date of the posting.
 Rec Room Inc's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision.
 The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Rec Room Inc.
 Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.

Resolving Disputes; Agreement to Arbitrate; Class Action & Jury Waiver

Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.
 It affects your legal rights.
 It provides for resolution of most disputes through individual arbitration instead of court trials and class actions.
 This section also contains a jury trial waiver and a waiver of any and all rights to proceed in class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted by the arbitral forum), private attorney general, or representative action in arbitration or litigation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.


AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE & CLASS ACTION/JURY WAIVER

You and Rec Room Inc agree that any dispute, claim or controversy between you and Rec Room, including but not limited to any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the Services or Content (collectively, ""Disputes""), whether such Disputes arose before, on, or subsequent to you entering these Terms, shall be exclusively resolved by individual, binding arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement.
 The arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms are unconscionable or illusory, in whole or in part, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.


Notwithstanding the foregoing and the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver below, each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction.
 In addition, (i) the parties each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (including anti-circumvention claims, or any other related statutory rights) (an ""IP Equity Action"") and (ii) Rec Room retains the right to bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction arising out of or relating to Your violation of the Prohibitions.
 You agree any disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or related to (i) and (ii) will be governed by Washington law and controlling United States federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions of any jurisdiction to the contrary, and any such disputes, claims, or controversies shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and you consent to venue in, the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington.


You acknowledge and agree that you and Rec Room are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted buy the arbitral forum), private attorney general, or representative proceeding.
 Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this ""Dispute Resolution"" section will survive any termination of these Terms.


To the extent that any claims are allowed to proceed on a class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted by the arbitral forum), or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction in Seattle, Washington, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Rec Room may participate in a class-wide settlement.


OPT OUT PROCEDURES

To opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, you must send us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”) by email at http://mailto:support@recroom.

 Additionally, if you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, you may still be bound to previous versions of this Arbitration Agreement by reason of your separate agreement to those previous versions.
 In other words, opting out of this Arbitration Agreement shall have no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements you may enter into with Rec Room.
 As stated above, if you do not opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within the Opt-Out Period, then you will be bound to the terms and conditions of this Arbitration Agreement which shall supersede and replace in its entirety all previous versions of Rec Room’s Arbitration Agreement.
 If you timely provide Rec Room with a valid Opt-Out Notice, all Disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and you consent to venue in, the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington.


ARBITRATION RULES

All Disputes shall be submitted to JAMS for arbitration before one arbitrator in accordance with the applicable JAMS clauses, rules, and procedures (the ""JAMS Rules"") or the JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) then in effect, except as modified by this ""Dispute Resolution"" section.
 The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.


If 75 or more similar Demands for Arbitration are presented by or with the assistance, coordination, or cooperation of the same law firm, group of law firms, cooperating law firms, or organization, JAMS’ Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines and Mass Arbitration Fee Schedule (the “JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules”) shall apply.


It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and the JAMS Rules and JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 If the FAA and the JAMS Rules and JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of Washington.


ARBITRATION PROCEDURE AND GOVERNING LAW

Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome.
 Therefore, in the event of a Dispute, you and Rec Room each agree to send the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice of Dispute” or “Notice”).
 A Notice of Dispute from you to Rec Room must be emailed to legal@recroom.
com (“Notice Address”).
 Any Notice of Dispute must include (i) the claimant’s full legal name, complete mailing address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) any relevant facts regarding claimant’s use of the Services or Content; and (iv) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice.
 The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person’s dispute.
 Rec Room will send any Notice of Dispute to you at the email address or mailing address it has for you, if any.


After receipt of a Notice of Dispute, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement).
 You and we agree that, after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, the recipient may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will attend (with counsel, if represented).


Compliance with this mandatory pre-arbitration Notice and informal dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration.
 Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this subsection.


Arbitration Location and Procedure: If the parties cannot resolve the Dispute through the above informal dispute resolution procedures, a party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).


If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Rec Room Inc submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
 If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).
 Any arbitration hearing will be conducted remotely by telephone or video conference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines, or the parties agree, that a hearing should be conducted in person, the arbitration hearing will take place as close to your residence as practicable, or another agreed upon locale.
 Subject to the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable), the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
 The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
 An arbitrator’s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.
 The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the ""Limitation of Liability"" section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.


Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).


Confidentiality: The parties agree that the arbitrator is authorized to issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law.
com within 30 days of the date of the posting of that change that provides (i) your full legal name, (ii) change(s) you are rejecting.
 This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether.


SEVERABILITY & SURVIVAL

If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement, or a portion thereof, is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible.
 The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein.


This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of these Terms.


General Terms

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to its conflict-of-laws provisions.
 These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Rec Room Inc and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Rec Room Inc and you regarding the Services and Content.

Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.
 It affects your legal rights.
 It provides for resolution of most disputes through individual arbitration instead of court trials and class actions.
 This section also contains a jury trial waiver and a waiver of any and all rights to proceed in class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted by the arbitral forum), private attorney general, or representative action in arbitration or litigation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.


AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE & CLASS ACTION/JURY WAIVER

You and Rec Room Inc agree that any dispute, claim or controversy between you and Rec Room, including but not limited to any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the Services or Content (collectively, ""Disputes""), whether such Disputes arose before, on, or subsequent to you entering these Terms, shall be exclusively resolved by individual, binding arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement.
 The arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms are unconscionable or illusory, in whole or in part, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.


Notwithstanding the foregoing and the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver below, each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction.
 In addition, (i) the parties each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (including anti-circumvention claims, or any other related statutory rights) (an ""IP Equity Action"") and (ii) Rec Room retains the right to bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction arising out of or relating to Your violation of the Prohibitions.
 You agree any disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or related to (i) and (ii) will be governed by Washington law and controlling United States federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions of any jurisdiction to the contrary, and any such disputes, claims, or controversies shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and you consent to venue in, the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington.


You acknowledge and agree that you and Rec Room are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted buy the arbitral forum), private attorney general, or representative proceeding.
 Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this ""Dispute Resolution"" section will survive any termination of these Terms.


To the extent that any claims are allowed to proceed on a class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted by the arbitral forum), or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction in Seattle, Washington, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Rec Room may participate in a class-wide settlement.


OPT OUT PROCEDURES

To opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, you must send us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”) by email at http://mailto:support@recroom.
com within 30 days from the date that you first accessed the Services or Content (“Opt-Out Period”).
 The Opt-Out Notice must contain your full legal name, your complete mailing and email address, a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, and your signature.
 If your Opt-Out Period has passed, you are not eligible to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.
 If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other provisions of the Terms will continue to apply to you.
 Additionally, if you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, you may still be bound to previous versions of this Arbitration Agreement by reason of your separate agreement to those previous versions.
 In other words, opting out of this Arbitration Agreement shall have no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements you may enter into with Rec Room.
 As stated above, if you do not opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within the Opt-Out Period, then you will be bound to the terms and conditions of this Arbitration Agreement which shall supersede and replace in its entirety all previous versions of Rec Room’s Arbitration Agreement.
 If you timely provide Rec Room with a valid Opt-Out Notice, all Disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and you consent to venue in, the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington.


ARBITRATION RULES

All Disputes shall be submitted to JAMS for arbitration before one arbitrator in accordance with the applicable JAMS clauses, rules, and procedures (the ""JAMS Rules"") or the JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) then in effect, except as modified by this ""Dispute Resolution"" section.
 The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.


If 75 or more similar Demands for Arbitration are presented by or with the assistance, coordination, or cooperation of the same law firm, group of law firms, cooperating law firms, or organization, JAMS’ Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines and Mass Arbitration Fee Schedule (the “JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules”) shall apply.


It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and the JAMS Rules and JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 If the FAA and the JAMS Rules and JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of Washington.


ARBITRATION PROCEDURE AND GOVERNING LAW

Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome.
 Therefore, in the event of a Dispute, you and Rec Room each agree to send the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice of Dispute” or “Notice”).
 A Notice of Dispute from you to Rec Room must be emailed to legal@recroom.
com (“Notice Address”).
 Any Notice of Dispute must include (i) the claimant’s full legal name, complete mailing address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) any relevant facts regarding claimant’s use of the Services or Content; and (iv) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice.
 The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person’s dispute.
 Rec Room will send any Notice of Dispute to you at the email address or mailing address it has for you, if any.


After receipt of a Notice of Dispute, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement).
 You and we agree that, after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, the recipient may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will attend (with counsel, if represented).


Compliance with this mandatory pre-arbitration Notice and informal dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration.
 Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this subsection.


Arbitration Location and Procedure: If the parties cannot resolve the Dispute through the above informal dispute resolution procedures, a party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).


If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Rec Room Inc submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
 If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).
 Any arbitration hearing will be conducted remotely by telephone or video conference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines, or the parties agree, that a hearing should be conducted in person, the arbitration hearing will take place as close to your residence as practicable, or another agreed upon locale.
 Subject to the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable), the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
 The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
 An arbitrator’s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.
 The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the ""Limitation of Liability"" section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.


Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).


Confidentiality: The parties agree that the arbitrator is authorized to issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law.
com within 30 days of the date of the posting of that change that provides (i) your full legal name, (ii) change(s) you are rejecting.
 This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether.


SEVERABILITY & SURVIVAL

If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement, or a portion thereof, is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible.
 The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein.


This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of these Terms.


General Terms

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to its conflict-of-laws provisions.
 These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Rec Room Inc and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Rec Room Inc and you regarding the Services and Content.
 If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the ""Arbitration"" section above or by court of competent jurisdiction), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
 You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Rec Room Inc's prior written consent.
 Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null.
 Rec Room Inc may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.
 Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
 Any notices or other communications provided by Rec Room Inc under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, may be given: (i) via email; (ii) by posting to the Services; or (iii) by certified mail.
 For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted and for notices made by posting to the Services, the date is the date of the posting.
 Rec Room Inc's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision.
 The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Rec Room Inc.
 Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.

Resolving Disputes; Agreement to Arbitrate; Class Action & Jury Waiver

Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.
 It affects your legal rights.
 It provides for resolution of most disputes through individual arbitration instead of court trials and class actions.
 This section also contains a jury trial waiver and a waiver of any and all rights to proceed in class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted by the arbitral forum), private attorney general, or representative action in arbitration or litigation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.


AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE & CLASS ACTION/JURY WAIVER

You and Rec Room Inc agree that any dispute, claim or controversy between you and Rec Room, including but not limited to any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the Services or Content (collectively, ""Disputes""), whether such Disputes arose before, on, or subsequent to you entering these Terms, shall be exclusively resolved by individual, binding arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement.
 The arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms are unconscionable or illusory, in whole or in part, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.


Notwithstanding the foregoing and the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver below, each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction.
 In addition, (i) the parties each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (including anti-circumvention claims, or any other related statutory rights) (an ""IP Equity Action"") and (ii) Rec Room retains the right to bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction arising out of or relating to Your violation of the Prohibitions.
 You agree any disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or related to (i) and (ii) will be governed by Washington law and controlling United States federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions of any jurisdiction to the contrary, and any such disputes, claims, or controversies shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and you consent to venue in, the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington.


You acknowledge and agree that you and Rec Room are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted buy the arbitral forum), private attorney general, or representative proceeding.
 Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this ""Dispute Resolution"" section will survive any termination of these Terms.


To the extent that any claims are allowed to proceed on a class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted by the arbitral forum), or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction in Seattle, Washington, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Rec Room may participate in a class-wide settlement.


OPT OUT PROCEDURES

To opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, you must send us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”) by email at http://mailto:support@recroom.
com within 30 days from the date that you first accessed the Services or Content (“Opt-Out Period”).
 The Opt-Out Notice must contain your full legal name, your complete mailing and email address, a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, and your signature.
 If your Opt-Out Period has passed, you are not eligible to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.
 If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other provisions of the Terms will continue to apply to you.
 Additionally, if you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, you may still be bound to previous versions of this Arbitration Agreement by reason of your separate agreement to those previous versions.
 In other words, opting out of this Arbitration Agreement shall have no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements you may enter into with Rec Room.
 As stated above, if you do not opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within the Opt-Out Period, then you will be bound to the terms and conditions of this Arbitration Agreement which shall supersede and replace in its entirety all previous versions of Rec Room’s Arbitration Agreement.
 If you timely provide Rec Room with a valid Opt-Out Notice, all Disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and you consent to venue in, the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington.


ARBITRATION RULES

All Disputes shall be submitted to JAMS for arbitration before one arbitrator in accordance with the applicable JAMS clauses, rules, and procedures (the ""JAMS Rules"") or the JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) then in effect, except as modified by this ""Dispute Resolution"" section.
 The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.


If 75 or more similar Demands for Arbitration are presented by or with the assistance, coordination, or cooperation of the same law firm, group of law firms, cooperating law firms, or organization, JAMS’ Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines and Mass Arbitration Fee Schedule (the “JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules”) shall apply.


It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and the JAMS Rules and JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 If the FAA and the JAMS Rules and JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of Washington.


ARBITRATION PROCEDURE AND GOVERNING LAW

Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome.
 Therefore, in the event of a Dispute, you and Rec Room each agree to send the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice of Dispute” or “Notice”).
 A Notice of Dispute from you to Rec Room must be emailed to legal@recroom.
com (“Notice Address”).
 Any Notice of Dispute must include (i) the claimant’s full legal name, complete mailing address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) any relevant facts regarding claimant’s use of the Services or Content; and (iv) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice.
 The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person’s dispute.
 Rec Room will send any Notice of Dispute to you at the email address or mailing address it has for you, if any.


After receipt of a Notice of Dispute, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement).
 You and we agree that, after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, the recipient may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will attend (with counsel, if represented).


Compliance with this mandatory pre-arbitration Notice and informal dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration.
 Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this subsection.


Arbitration Location and Procedure: If the parties cannot resolve the Dispute through the above informal dispute resolution procedures, a party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).


If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Rec Room Inc submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
 If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).
 Any arbitration hearing will be conducted remotely by telephone or video conference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines, or the parties agree, that a hearing should be conducted in person, the arbitration hearing will take place as close to your residence as practicable, or another agreed upon locale.
 Subject to the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable), the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
 The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
 An arbitrator’s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.
 The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the ""Limitation of Liability"" section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.


Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).


Confidentiality: The parties agree that the arbitrator is authorized to issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law.
com within 30 days of the date of the posting of that change that provides (i) your full legal name, (ii) change(s) you are rejecting.
 This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether.


SEVERABILITY & SURVIVAL

If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement, or a portion thereof, is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible.
 The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein.


This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of these Terms.


General Terms

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to its conflict-of-laws provisions.
 These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Rec Room Inc and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Rec Room Inc and you regarding the Services and Content.
 If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the ""Arbitration"" section above or by court of competent jurisdiction), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
 You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Rec Room Inc's prior written consent.
 Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null.
 Rec Room Inc may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.
 Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
 Any notices or other communications provided by Rec Room Inc under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, may be given: (i) via email; (ii) by posting to the Services; or (iii) by certified mail.
 For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted and for notices made by posting to the Services, the date is the date of the posting.
 Rec Room Inc's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision.
 The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Rec Room Inc.
 Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.

Resolving Disputes; Agreement to Arbitrate; Class Action & Jury Waiver

Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.
 It affects your legal rights.
 It provides for resolution of most disputes through individual arbitration instead of court trials and class actions.
 This section also contains a jury trial waiver and a waiver of any and all rights to proceed in class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted by the arbitral forum), private attorney general, or representative action in arbitration or litigation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.


AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE & CLASS ACTION/JURY WAIVER

You and Rec Room Inc agree that any dispute, claim or controversy between you and Rec Room, including but not limited to any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the Services or Content (collectively, ""Disputes""), whether such Disputes arose before, on, or subsequent to you entering these Terms, shall be exclusively resolved by individual, binding arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement.
 The arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms are unconscionable or illusory, in whole or in part, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.


Notwithstanding the foregoing and the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver below, each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction.
 In addition, (i) the parties each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (including anti-circumvention claims, or any other related statutory rights) (an ""IP Equity Action"") and (ii) Rec Room retains the right to bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction arising out of or relating to Your violation of the Prohibitions.
 You agree any disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or related to (i) and (ii) will be governed by Washington law and controlling United States federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions of any jurisdiction to the contrary, and any such disputes, claims, or controversies shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and you consent to venue in, the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington.


You acknowledge and agree that you and Rec Room are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted buy the arbitral forum), private attorney general, or representative proceeding.
 Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this ""Dispute Resolution"" section will survive any termination of these Terms.


To the extent that any claims are allowed to proceed on a class, collective, consolidated (other than any batching procedures conducted by the arbitral forum), or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction in Seattle, Washington, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Rec Room may participate in a class-wide settlement.


OPT OUT PROCEDURES

To opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, you must send us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”) by email at http://mailto:support@recroom.
com within 30 days from the date that you first accessed the Services or Content (“Opt-Out Period”).
 The Opt-Out Notice must contain your full legal name, your complete mailing and email address, a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, and your signature.
 If your Opt-Out Period has passed, you are not eligible to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.
 If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other provisions of the Terms will continue to apply to you.
 Additionally, if you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, you may still be bound to previous versions of this Arbitration Agreement by reason of your separate agreement to those previous versions.
 In other words, opting out of this Arbitration Agreement shall have no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements you may enter into with Rec Room.
 As stated above, if you do not opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within the Opt-Out Period, then you will be bound to the terms and conditions of this Arbitration Agreement which shall supersede and replace in its entirety all previous versions of Rec Room’s Arbitration Agreement.
 If you timely provide Rec Room with a valid Opt-Out Notice, all Disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and you consent to venue in, the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington.


ARBITRATION RULES

All Disputes shall be submitted to JAMS for arbitration before one arbitrator in accordance with the applicable JAMS clauses, rules, and procedures (the ""JAMS Rules"") or the JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) then in effect, except as modified by this ""Dispute Resolution"" section.
 The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.


If 75 or more similar Demands for Arbitration are presented by or with the assistance, coordination, or cooperation of the same law firm, group of law firms, cooperating law firms, or organization, JAMS’ Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines and Mass Arbitration Fee Schedule (the “JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules”) shall apply.


It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and the JAMS Rules and JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 If the FAA and the JAMS Rules and JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of Washington.


ARBITRATION PROCEDURE AND GOVERNING LAW

Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome.
 Therefore, in the event of a Dispute, you and Rec Room each agree to send the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice of Dispute” or “Notice”).
 A Notice of Dispute from you to Rec Room must be emailed to legal@recroom.
com (“Notice Address”).
 Any Notice of Dispute must include (i) the claimant’s full legal name, complete mailing address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) any relevant facts regarding claimant’s use of the Services or Content; and (iv) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice.
 The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person’s dispute.
 Rec Room will send any Notice of Dispute to you at the email address or mailing address it has for you, if any.


After receipt of a Notice of Dispute, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement).
 You and we agree that, after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, the recipient may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will attend (with counsel, if represented).


Compliance with this mandatory pre-arbitration Notice and informal dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration.
 Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this subsection.


Arbitration Location and Procedure: If the parties cannot resolve the Dispute through the above informal dispute resolution procedures, a party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).


If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Rec Room Inc submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
 If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).
 Any arbitration hearing will be conducted remotely by telephone or video conference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines, or the parties agree, that a hearing should be conducted in person, the arbitration hearing will take place as close to your residence as practicable, or another agreed upon locale.
 Subject to the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable), the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
 The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
 An arbitrator’s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.
 The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the ""Limitation of Liability"" section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.


Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).


Confidentiality: The parties agree that the arbitrator is authorized to issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law.
com within 30 days of the date of the posting of that change that provides (i) your full legal name, (ii) change(s) you are rejecting.
 This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether.


SEVERABILITY & SURVIVAL

If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement, or a portion thereof, is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible.
 The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein.


This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of these Terms.


General Terms

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to its conflict-of-laws provisions.
 These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Rec Room Inc and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Rec Room Inc and you regarding the Services and Content.

 For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted and for notices made by posting to the Services, the date is the date of the posting.

 The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Rec Room Inc.
 Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.

ARBITRATION RULES

All Disputes shall be submitted to JAMS for arbitration before one arbitrator in accordance with the applicable JAMS clauses, rules, and procedures (the ""JAMS Rules"") or the JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) then in effect, except as modified by this ""Dispute Resolution"" section.
 The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.


If 75 or more similar Demands for Arbitration are presented by or with the assistance, coordination, or cooperation of the same law firm, group of law firms, cooperating law firms, or organization, JAMS’ Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines and Mass Arbitration Fee Schedule (the “JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules”) shall apply.


It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and the JAMS Rules and JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 If the FAA and the JAMS Rules and JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable) are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of Washington.


ARBITRATION PROCEDURE AND GOVERNING LAW

Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome.
 Therefore, in the event of a Dispute, you and Rec Room each agree to send the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice of Dispute” or “Notice”).
 A Notice of Dispute from you to Rec Room must be emailed to legal@recroom.
com (“Notice Address”).
 Any Notice of Dispute must include (i) the claimant’s full legal name, complete mailing address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) any relevant facts regarding claimant’s use of the Services or Content; and (iv) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice.
 The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person’s dispute.
 Rec Room will send any Notice of Dispute to you at the email address or mailing address it has for you, if any.


After receipt of a Notice of Dispute, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement).
 You and we agree that, after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, the recipient may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will attend (with counsel, if represented).


Compliance with this mandatory pre-arbitration Notice and informal dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration.
 Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this subsection.


Arbitration Location and Procedure: If the parties cannot resolve the Dispute through the above informal dispute resolution procedures, a party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).


If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Rec Room Inc submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
 If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).
 Any arbitration hearing will be conducted remotely by telephone or video conference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines, or the parties agree, that a hearing should be conducted in person, the arbitration hearing will take place as close to your residence as practicable, or another agreed upon locale.
 Subject to the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable), the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
 The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
 An arbitrator’s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.
 The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the ""Limitation of Liability"" section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.


Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules or JAMS Mass Arbitration Rules (as applicable).


Confidentiality: The parties agree that the arbitrator is authorized to issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law.
com within 30 days of the date of the posting of that change that provides (i) your full legal name, (ii) change(s) you are rejecting.
 This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether.


SEVERABILITY & SURVIVAL

If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement, or a portion thereof, is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible.
 The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein.


This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of these Terms.

 For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted and for notices made by posting to the Services, the date is the date of the posting.

 The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Rec Room Inc.
